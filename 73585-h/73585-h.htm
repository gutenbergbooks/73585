</div>

<p>But few words of Preface are needed for a work which
will sufficiently explain itself. It is an attempt to give
a systematic account of the Science of Language, its
nature, its progress and its aims, which shall be at the
same time as thorough and exhaustive as our present
knowledge and materials allow. How far the attempt
has been successful is for the reader to judge; the author
cannot do more than his best. The method and theories
which underlie the work have been set forth in my
“Principles of Comparative Philology,” where I have
criticized certain of the current assumptions of scientific
philology, and endeavoured to show their inadequacy or
positive error. It is gratifying to find that my views and
conclusions have been accepted by leading authorities on
the subject, and I shall, therefore, make no apology for
tacitly assuming them in the present work. So far as
the latter is concerned, however, it matters little whether
they are right or wrong; an Introduction necessarily has
mainly to deal with the statement and arrangement of
ascertained facts. The theories the facts are called upon
to support are of secondary importance.</p>

<p>It may be objected that I have handled some parts
of the subject at disproportionate length. But it has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
seemed to me that an Introduction should give a survey
of the whole field to be explored, and not neglect any
portion of it for the sake of literary unity or easy reading.
There is certain work which must be done once for all,
if the ground is to be cleared for future research and
progress, and if well done need not be done again. The
historical retrospect in the first chapter is indispensable
for a right understanding of the “Science of Language;”
but in writing it I have tried not to forget that brevity is
a virtue as well as completeness. It is the fault of the
subject-matter if the chapter seems unduly long.</p>

<p>Exception may perhaps be taken to the use I have
made of the languages and condition of modern savage
tribes to illustrate those of primitive man. It is quite
true that in many cases savage tribes are examples of
degeneracy from a higher and less savage state; the
Arctic Highlanders of Ross and Parry, for instance,
have retrograded in social habits, and the disuse of boats
and harpoons, from the Eskimaux of the south; and if we
pass from savage to more civilized races there is distinct
evidence in the language of the Polynesians that they
have lapsed from a superior level of civilization. It is
also quite true that, however degraded a tribe or race
may now be, it is necessarily much in advance of palæolithic
man when he first began to create a language
for himself, and to discover the use of fire. Nevertheless,
it is in modern savages and, to a less degree, in young
children, that we have to look for the best representatives
we can find of primæval man; and so long as we
remember that they are but imperfect representatives we
shall not go far wrong in our scientific inferences. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
Professor Max Müller has said:<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “The idea that, in
order to understand what the so-called civilized people
may have been before they reached their higher enlightenment,
we ought to study savage tribes, such as we
find them still at the present day, is perfectly just. It is
the lesson which geology has taught us, applied to the
stratification of the human race.”</p>

<p>In the matter of language, however, we are less likely
to make mistakes in arguing from the modern savage to
the first men than in other departments of anthropology.
Here we can better distinguish between old and new,
can trace the gradual growth of ideas and forms, and
determine where articulate language passes into those
inarticulate efforts to speak out of which it originally
arose. In fact, a chief part of the services rendered to
glottology by the study and observation of savage and
barbarous idioms consists in the verification they afford
of the results of our analysis of cultivated and historical
languages. If, for example, this leads us to the conclusion
that grammatical simplicity is the last point reached
in the evolution of language, we must go to savage dialects
for confirmation before we can accept the conclusion
as proven. Moreover, there is much of the primitive
machinery of speech which has been lost in the languages
of the civilized nations of the world, but preserved in the
more conservative idioms of savage tribes—for savages,
it must be remembered, are the most conservative of
human beings; while were we to confine our attention to
the groups of tongues spoken by civilized races we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
form but a very partial and erroneous view of language
and its structure, since the conceptions upon which the
grammars of the several families of speech are based are
as various as the families of speech themselves. Nor
must we forget the lesson of etymology, that the poverty
of ideas with which even our own Aryan (or rather præ-Aryan)
ancestors started was as great as that of the
lowest savages of to-day.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to Professor Mahaffy for his
kindness in looking over the sheets of the present work
during its passage through the press, and to Mr. Henry
Sweet for performing the same kind offices towards the
fourth chapter. Mr. Sweet’s name will guarantee the
freedom of the chapter from phonetic heresies. I have
also to tender my thanks to Professor Rolleston for the
help he has given me in the preparation of the diagrams
which accompany the work, while I hardly know how to
express my gratitude sufficiently to Mr. W. G. Hird, of
Bradford, who has taken upon himself the onerous task
of providing an index to the two volumes. How onerous
such a labour is can be realized only by those who have
already undergone it.</p>

<span class="smaller">THEORIES OF LANGUAGE.</span></h2>

<p>“If we preserve in our histories of the world the names of those
who are said to have discovered the physical elements—the names
of Thales, and Anaximenes, and Empedocles—we ought not to forget
the names of the discoverers of the elements of language—the
founders of one of the most useful and most successful branches of
philosophy—the first grammarians.”—<span class="smcap">Max Müller.</span></p>

</div>

<p>“Speech is silvern, silence is golden,” is the well-known
saying of a modern prophet, wearied with the idle utterances
of a transition age, and forgetful that the <i>prophet</i>, or
προφητής, is himself but the “spokesman” of another, and
that the era which changed the Hebrew seer into the <i>Nabi</i>,
or “proclaimer,” brought with it also the beginning of
culture and civilization, and the consciousness of a high religious
destiny. Far truer was the instinct of the old poet
of the Rig-Veda, the most ancient monument of our Aryan
literature, written, it may be, fifteen centuries before the
birth of Christ, when he calls “the Word” one of the
highest goddesses “which rushes onward like the wind,
which bursts through heaven and earth, and, awe-inspiring
to each one that it loves, makes him a Brahman,
a poet, and a sage.” The haphazard etymology which
saw in the μέροπες ἄνθρωποι of Homer “articulate-speaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
men,” must indeed be given up, but we may still picture
to ourselves the “winged words” which seemed inspired
with the life and divinity of Hermês, or the sacred Muses
from whom the Greek singer drew all his genius and
power. Language is at once the bond and the creation
of society, the symbol and token of the boundary between
man and brute.</p>

<p>We must be careful to remember that language includes
any kind of instrumentality whereby we communicate
our thoughts and feelings to others, and therefore
that the deaf-mute who can converse only with the
fingers or the lips is as truly gifted with the power of
speech as the man who can articulate his words. The
latter has a more perfect instrument at his command, but
that is all. Indeed, it is quite possible to conceive of a
community in which all communications were carried
on with the hands alone; to this day savage tribes make
a large use of gestures, and we are told that the Grebos
of Africa ordinarily indicate the persons and tenses of
the verb by this means only. Wherever there is the
power of making our thoughts intelligible to another, or
even simply the possibility of this power, as in the case
of the infant, there we have language, although for ordinary
purposes the term may be restricted to spoken or
articulate speech. It is in this sense that language will
be understood in the following pages.</p>

<p>Now one of the earliest subjects of reflection was the
language in which that reflection clothed itself. The
power of words was clear even to the barbarian, and
yet at the same time it was equally clear that he himself
exercised a certain power over them. Wonder, it has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
been said, is the mother of science, and out of the
wonder excited by the great mystery of language came
speculations on its nature and its origin. What, it was
asked, are those modulations of the voice, those emissions
of the breath, which inform others of what is passing
in our innermost souls, and without which the most
rudimentary form of society would be impossible? Perhaps
it was in Babylonia that the first attempt was
made to answer the question. Here there was a great
mixture of races and languages, and here it was accordingly
that the scene of the confusion of tongues
was laid. The Tower of Babel, the great temple of the
Seven Lights of Borsippa, whose remains we may still see
in the ruins of the Birs-i-Nimrúd, was, it was believed,
the cause and origin of the diversity of human speech.
Men endeavoured to make themselves equal to the
gods, and to storm heaven like the giants of Greek
mythology, but the winds frustrated their attempts, and
heaven itself confounded their speech. Such was the
native legend, fragments of which have been brought
from the Assyrian library of Assur-bani-pal, or Sardanapalus,
and which cannot fail to bring to our minds the
familiar history of Genesis.</p>

<p>Now the same library that has given us these fragments
has also given us the first beginnings of what we
may call comparative philology. The science, the art,
and the literature of Babylonia had been the work of an
early people who spoke an agglutinative language, and
from them it had all been borrowed and perhaps improved
upon by the later Semitic settlers in the country.
Their language, which for the want of a better name we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
will call Accadian, had ceased to be spoken before the
seventeenth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, but not before the civilization
and culture it enshrined had been adopted by a new race,
who had to study and learn the dead tongue in which they
were preserved, as the scholars of the Middle Ages had
to study and learn Latin. Hence came the need of dictionaries,
grammars, and reading-books; and the clay
tablets of Nineveh accordingly present us not only with
interlinear and parallel Assyrian translations of Accadian
texts, arranged upon the Hamiltonian method, but also
with syllabaries and lexicons, with phrase-books and
grammars of the two languages. It is the first attempt
ever made to draw up a grammar, and the comparative
form the attempt has assumed shows how impossible
was even the suggestion of such a thing without the
comparison of more than one form of speech. The vocabularies
are compiled sometimes on a classificatory
principle, sometimes on an alphabetic one, sometimes
on the principle of grouping a number of derivations
around their common root; and the latter principle
enunciates at once the primary doctrine and object of
comparative philology—the analysis of language into
its simplest elements. With the discovery of roots we
may date the possibility and the beginning of linguistic
science.</p>

<p>Next in order of time to the grammarians of Babylonia
and Assyria came the grammarians of India, whose
labours again were called forth by the comparison of
different forms of speech. The sacred language of the
Veda had already become antiquated and obscure, while
the rise and spread of Buddhism had raised more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
one popular dialect to the rank of a literary language,
and obliged the educated Hindu not only to study his
own speech in its earlier and later forms, but to compare
it with other more or less related idioms as well.
Since Indian philology, however, is intimately connected
with the history of the modern science of Language, it
will be more convenient to consider it further on.</p>

<p>The problems of language were naturally among the
first to present themselves to the activity of the Greek
mind. Already the instinct of their wonderful speech,
itself the fitting creation and reflex of the national character,
had found in the word λόγος an expression of the
close relationship that exists between reasoned thought
and the words in which it clothes itself; and the question
which Greek philosophy sought to answer was the
nature of this relationship, and of the language wherein
it is embodied. Do words exist, it was asked, <i>by nature</i>
(φύσει) or <i>by convention</i> (θέσει); do the sounds which we
utter exactly and necessarily represent things as they are
in themselves, or are they merely the arbitrary marks and
symbols conventionally assigned to the objects we observe
and the conceptions we form? This was the question that
the greatest of the Greek thinkers attempted to solve; and
the controversy it called forth divided Greek philosophy
into two camps, and lies at the bottom of all its contributions
to linguistic science. It is true that the question was
really a philosophic one, and that the advocates of free-will
on the one side, and of necessity on the other, naturally saw
in speech either the creation and plaything of the human
will, or else a power over which man has as little control
as over the forces of nature. Important as were the results<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
of this controversy, not only to the philosophy of language,
but yet more to the formation of grammar, it was
impossible for a <i>science</i> of language to arise out of it: its
results were logical rather than linguistic, for science requires
the patient <i>à posteriori</i> method of induction, not
the <i>à priori</i> method of immature philosophizing, however
brilliantly handled. The Greeks had, indeed, grasped a
truth which has too often been forgotten in modern
times, the truth that language is but the outward embodiment
and crystallization of thought; but they overlooked
the fact that to discover its nature and its laws
we must observe and classify its external phænomena,
and not until we have ascertained by this means the
conditions under which thought externalizes itself in
language, can we get back to that thought itself.</p>

<p>Greek researches into language fall into three chief
periods, the period of the præ-Sokratic philosophy, when
language in general was the subject of inquiry, the period
of the Sophists, when the categories of universal grammar
were being distinguished and worked out, and the period
of Alexandrine criticism, when the rules of Greek grammar
in particular were elaborated. Herakleitus and Demokritus
are the representatives of the first period: the one
the advocate of the innate and necessary connection
between words and the objects they denote, the other
of the absolute power possessed by man to invent or
change his speech. The dispute, however, was soon
shifted from words as they are to words as they once
were; since on the one hand it was manifest that the
union assumed to exist between words and objects could
no longer be pointed out in the majority of instances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and on the other hand that numerous words are merely
the later corruptions of earlier forms, so that the invention
of even a single word must be pushed back to
an age far beyond the oldest experience. Hence grew
up the so-called science of <i>etymology</i>, a science whose
name, it must be confessed, fully justified one of its leading
principles which resulted in the derivation of <i>lucus
a non lucendo</i>, “because the sun does <i>not</i> shine therein.”
Ἐτυμο-λογία was “the science of the truth,” the ascertainment
of the true origin of words; but in Greek hands its
truer designation would have been the “science of falsehood”
and guess-work. Its follies have been enshrined
in ponderous works like the “Etymologicum Magnum” or
the “Onomastikon” of Pollux; and its curious illustrations
of the absurdities into which a clever and active intellect
will fall when deprived of the guidance of the scientific
method of comparison, are scattered broadcast through
the writings of Greek thinkers. Two of its rules, for instance,
both founded on the assumption of the “natural”
origin of words, lay down that the word undergoes the
same modifications as the thing it denotes, and that objects
may be named from their contraries (κατ’ ἀντίφρασιν);
and hence it was easy to derive φιλητής, “a thief,” from
ὑφέλεσθαι, “to steal,” by “depriving” the latter word of
its first syllable, and to see in <i>cœlum</i>, “heaven,” <i>cœlatum</i>,
“covered,” “because it is open,” or in <i>fœdus</i>, “covenant,”
<i>fœdus</i>, “hateful,” “because there is nothing
hateful in it.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> After this we need not smile at Plato’s
derivation of θεοί, “gods,” from θέειν, “to run,” because the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
stars were first worshipped, or Aristotle’s assumption that
objects are easy of digestion when they are “light” in
weight. Dr. Jolly has pointed out that the fact that ἐτυμός
is Ionic indicates the origin of the pseudo-science in the
Ionic schools of philosophy; it is therefore a remarkable
illustration of the “self-sufficient” nature of Greek thought
and of Greek contempt for the “barbarian,” that the
dialects of Asia Minor, though so closely akin to Greek,
should have been utterly disregarded, and the investigations
into language consequently left to the vagaries of
the fancy without the light of comparison to guide them
to the truth. Plato in the “Kratylus” is almost the only
Greek who has noticed the resemblance of one of these
“barbarous” dialects to his own, and he has only noticed
it to draw a wrong conclusion from the fact. Many Greek
words, he maintains, were borrowed from abroad; and
by way of examples he quotes κύων (the Sanskrit <i>śwan</i>,
the Latin <i>canis</i>, and our <i>hound</i>), ὑδώρ (the Sanskrit <i>udam</i>,
the Latin <i>unda</i>, and our <i>water</i>), and πῦρ (the Latin <i>pruna</i>,
the Umbrian <i>pir</i>, and our <i>fire</i>), as being identical with
the names of the same objects in Phrygian. The very
fact, however, that Plato has noticed this resemblance
shows that the stimulating influence of contact with
Persia was still felt, even in the domain of language,
when the Greeks found themselves in the presence of an
allied and similar civilization, with all its contrasts to
their own, and when men like Themistokles found it politic
to acquire a fluent knowledge of the Persian tongue.
It was not until the Empire of Alexander had overthrown
that of Cyrus and Darius and impressed upon the Greek
a sovereign contempt for the Asiatic, and an equal belief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
in his own innate superiority, that any regard for the
jargons of the “barbarians” became altogether out of
the question. It was then that the masterpieces of early
Greek literature came to be the sole objects of study and
investigation, and philological research took the form of
that one-sided, and therefore erroneous, exposition of the
grammar of a single language, which has been the bane
of classical philology down to our own time.</p>

<p>The linguistic labours of the age of the Sophists were
occasioned by the needs of oratory. When rhetoric became
a profitable and all-powerful pursuit, and the end of
education was held to be the ability to hold one’s own,
whether right or wrong, and confute one’s neighbour,
words necessarily came to be regarded as more valuable
than things, and the main care and attention of the
sophist were bestowed upon the form of his sentences
and the style of his argument. Just as language had
been approached in the preceding period from a purely
metaphysical point of view, and was to be approached in
the succeeding period from a logical point of view, so now
it was looked at from the side of rhetoric. It was not <i>etymology</i>,
a knowledge of the “truth,” that was wanted, but a
knowledge of the composition of sentences and of the way
in which they could best be arranged for the purposes of
persuasion. The first outlines of European grammar accordingly
go back to this Sophistic age. We find Protagoras
criticizing the opening verse of the Iliad, because
μῆνις, “wrath,” is used as a feminine, contrary to the
sense of the word, or distinguishing the three genders
and busying himself with the discovery of the verbal
moods, while the lectures of Prodikus were occupied with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the analysis and definition of synonyms. Some idea
may be formed of the grammatical zeal of the Sophists
from the “Clouds” of Aristophanes,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> where he ridicules
the pedantry that would force the artificial rules of
grammar upon the usage of living speech.</p>

<p>Plato and Aristotle, the products of the impulse given
to thought by that greatest of the Sophists, Sokrates,
form the connecting link between the Sophistic and the
Alexandrine periods, and renew in the shape required
by the progress of philosophy the old contest regarding
the nature of language between the followers of Herakleitus
and those of Demokritus. In philology as
elsewhere, the idealism of Plato stands opposed to the
practical realism of his pupil Aristotle. Plato paints
language as it ought to be; Aristotle reasons upon it as
it is. But in both cases it was not language in general,
but the Greek language in particular, that was meant;
and owing to this short-sightedness of view and disregard
of the comparative method, the theories of each, however
suggestive and stimulating, are yet devoid of scientific
value and mainly interesting to the historian alone. The
problem of Plato’s “Kratylus” is the natural fittingness of
words, which finally resolves itself into the question how
it happens that a word is understood by the bearer in the
same sense as it is intended by the speaker. No answer
is given to the question; but the dialogue gives occasion
for a complete review of the linguistic opinions prevalent
at the time, and the conclusion put into the mouth of
Sokrates is that while in actual (Greek) speech no natural
and innate connection can be traced between words and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
things, it were much to be wished that an ideal speech
could be created in which this natural connection would
exist. In this wish, as Dr. Jolly remarks, Plato shows
himself the forerunner of Leibnitz and Bishop Wilkins,
the one with his “Lingua characteristica universalis,” and
the other with his “Essay towards a real Character and a
Philosophical Language.”</p>

<p>Aristotle, as might be expected, will have nothing to
do with the theory of the natural origin of speech. He
declares himself unequivocally on the side of its opponents,
and lays down that language originates through
the agreement and convention of men (συνθήκῃ). Words,
he holds, have no meaning in themselves; this is put
into them by those who utter them, and they then become
so many symbols of the objects signified (ὅταν γίνεται
σύμβολον). “For the sentence (λόγος), when heard, makes
one’s meaning intelligible, not necessarily but accidentally,
since it consists of words, and each word is a
symbol.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At the same time Aristotle makes no clear
distinction between thought and language; <i>concept</i> and
<i>word</i> are with him interchangeable terms; and his famous
ten categories into which all objects can be classed are as
much grammatical as logical, or perhaps more rightly a
mixture of both. In his hands the rhetorical gives way
to the logical treatment of language, and the sentence is
analyzed in the interests of formal logic. As Kant and
Hegel observed long ago, the logical system of Aristotle
is purely empirical; it is based on the grammar
of a single language, and is nothing but an analysis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
of the mode in which the framers of that language
unconsciously thought. To understand and criticize it
properly we must bear this fact in mind, and remember
that the system cannot be corrected or replaced until
comparative philology has taught us to distinguish between
the universal and the particular in the grammar of
Greek and Aryan. Whatever injury, however, logic may
have suffered from having been thus built up upon the
idiosyncrasies of the Greek Sentence, Greek grammar
gained an equivalent advantage. Besides the ὄνομα or
“noun,” and the ῥῆμα or “verb,” Aristotle now added to
it the σύνδεσμος or “particle,” and introduced the term
πτῶσις or “case,” to denote any kind of flection whatsoever.
He also divided nouns into simple and compound,
invented for the neuter another name (τὸ μεταξύ) than
that given by Protagoras, and starting from the termination
of the nominative singular endeavoured to ascertain
the rules for denoting a difference of gender.</p>

<p>The work begun by Aristotle was continued by the
Stoics, who perfected his grammatical system just as they
had perfected his logical system. They separated the
ἄρθρον or “article” from the particles, and determined a
fifth part of speech, the πανδέκτης or “adverb;” they confined
the πτῶσις or “case” to the flections of the noun, and
distinguished the four principal cases by names, the Latin
translations or mistranslations of which are now so familiar
to us; they divided the verb into its tenses, moods, and
classes, and in the person of Chrysippus, the adherent of
the Stoic school (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 280-206), separated nouns into
<i>appellativa</i> and <i>propria</i>. But, like Aristotle, they assumed
the same laws for both thought and language, and were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
thus led into difficulties and fallacies which the slightest
acquaintance with another language might have prevented.
Thus the logical copula was confounded with the
substantive verb by which it was expressed in Greece,
and false arguments were framed and supported on this
assumption. Their opponents, the Epicureans, contented
themselves with inquiries into the origin of speech, which
had to be explained, like everything else, in accordance
with the theory of atoms. The large part, however,
played by the action of society in their system gave their
theorizing upon the subject an accidental aspect of truth
which at first sight is somewhat surprising; and even the
well-known lines of Horace (Sat. I. 3. 99, <i>sq.</i>) contain a
more correct representation of the primitive condition of
man and the evolution of language than the speculations
current upon the matter up to the last few years. Language,
it was held, existed φύσει, not θέσει; but the nature
which originated speech was not external nature, but the
nature of man. The different sounds and utterances
whereby the same object is denoted in different languages
are due to the varying circumstances in which the speakers
find themselves, and are as much determined by their
climate and social condition, their constitution and physique,
as the lowing of the ox or the bleating of the lamb.
Men, indeed, create speech, not however deliberately and
with intention (ἐπιστημόνως), but instinctively through the
impulse of their nature (φυσικῶς κινούμενοι).<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> We may perhaps
trace in these expressions the germs of the theory of
the onomatopœic origin of language.</p>

<p>While the Epicureans were speculating on the origin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of speech, the grammarians of Alexandria were busying
themselves with the elaboration of what the French would
call a <i>grammaire raisonnée</i>. “Alexandria,” says Dr.
Jolly, “was the birthplace of classical philology, a study
which has directly raised itself upon the ruins of the old
Hellenic culture and spiritual originality.” The intense
mental activity and productiveness of Athens had made
way for the frigid pedantry and artificial mannerisms of
commentators and court-poets; the free national life and
small rival states of Greece had been replaced by a semi-oriental
despotism and a cosmopolitan centralization; and
unable themselves to emulate the great creations of the
classic age, the literary coterie of the Alexandrine Museum
could do no more than admire and edit them. The very
dialect in which the Attic tragedians and historians had
composed and written had become strange and foreign,
while the language of the Homeric Poems, which it must
be remembered were to the Greeks what the Bible is to
us, seemed as obscure and obsolete to the Alexandrine,
as the tongue of Layamon or Piers Plowman does to the
ordinary Englishman. If we add to this the existence of
numerous and discordant copies of Homer, we have
abundant reason for the growth of that large army of
commentators, grammarians, and lexicographers which
characterized the schools of Alexandria and laid the
foundations of literary criticism. A minute investigation
of the grammatical facts of the Greek language was
rendered necessary, and a comparison of the older and
later forms of the language as well as of its dialects
grounded this investigation upon a comparatively secure
basis. The metaphysical turn, however, given to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
first linguistic inquiries still overshadowed the whole
study, and the absurd and misleading “science of
etymology” remained to the last the evil genius of Greek
philology. The old dispute as to the origin of words
now assumed a new form, mainly through the influence
of the Stoic and Epicurean systems of philosophy,
and the schools of Alexandria were divided into the
two contending factions of Analogists and Anomalists.
The first, among whom was counted the famous Homeric
critic Aristarchus, found in language a strict law of analogy
between concept and word, which was wholly denied by
the others. It was round this question that Greek
philology ranged itself from the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to
the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and out of the controversy it occasioned
was formed that Greek grammar which created the
scholars of the last four hundred years, and is still so
widely taught in our own country. Thus Aristarchus,
for instance, in his anxiety to smooth away every irregularity
and remove all exceptions to the rules he had
formulated, determined that the genitive and dative of
Ζεύς should no longer be Διός or Ζῆνος, but Ζεός, and Ζεΐ, and
the endeavours of his opponents to upset this piece of
pedantry led to the discovery of other similar exceptions
to the general rule, and to the complete settlement of this
portion of the grammar. Krates of Mallos, the head of
the Pergamenian school, stands forward as the chief rival
of Aristarchus on the opposite side. In his hands
“anomaly” was made the leading principle of language,
and general rules of any sort flatly denied, except in so
far as they were consecrated by custom. The purism of
his opponents, who wished to correct everything which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
contravened the grammatical laws they had laid down,
was thus met by an unqualified defence of the rights
of usage—“quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma
loquendi.” Our own schoolmasters who have introduced
an <i>l</i> into <i>could</i> (<i>coud</i>), the past tense of <i>can</i>, because <i>should</i>
from <i>shall</i> has one, or have prefixed a <i>w</i> to <i>whole</i>, the
twin-brother of <i>hale</i> (Greek καλός), because of the analogy
of <i>wheel</i> and <i>which</i>, are the fitting successors of the
Alexandrine Analogists, and it was unfortunate for
both that they had no Aristophanes to transfer them to
cloudland, and ridicule them in the light of common sense.</p>

<p>Krates, however, has better claims upon our attention
than as leader of the Anomalists. To him we owe the
first formal Greek grammar and collection of the grammatical
facts obtained by the labours of the Alexandrine
critics. That a formal grammar, which implies an enunciation
of general rules as well as of the exceptions to
them, should have been the work of an Anomalist rather
than of an Analogist, may at first sight seem surprising;
but we must recollect that the Anomalist did not deny
the existence of general rules altogether, but only their
universal and unqualified applicability; while the Analogist
who sought to produce an artificial uniformity in
language instead of accepting the facts of speech as they
are, was totally unfitted for composing a practical
grammar.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The immediate cause, however, of the grammar in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
question was really the tardy comparison of Greek with
a foreign tongue, the Latin, and the need of a Greek
grammar felt by the citizens of Rome. Appius Claudius
Cæcus (censor in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 312) had already written upon
grammar,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and Spurius Carvilius, a writing-master (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
234), had regulated the Latin alphabet, substituting the
indispensable <i>g</i> for the useless <i>z</i>, and when Krates came
to Rome in 159 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, as the Ambassador of Attalus, the
King of Pergamos, he found a ready audience for his
ἀκροάσεις, or “lectures” upon the study of Greek. Almost
all that the Romans knew of literary culture and civilization
came from the Greeks; their native literature was
coarse and insignificant, and their language uncultivated
and inflexible. Education at Rome, therefore, meant
education upon Greek models and in the Greek language.
Boys learned Greek before they learned Latin, and the
Greek words with which the plays of Plautus are strewn,
as well as their Alexandrine origin, show pretty plainly
that a familiarity with the language of Greece was not
confined to the literary <i>salon</i> of a Scipio, or the houses
of a wealthy aristocracy. Livius Andronicus, the father
of Latin literature, was a Greek professor (272 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and
his translation of the “Odyssey” into Latin was doubtless
for the use of his pupils;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the first history of Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
that of Fabius Pictor (in 200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), was written in Greek;
and even a popular tribune like Tiberius Gracchus published
the Greek speech he had made at Rhodes. In fact,
a knowledge of Greek was necessary not only for acquiring
the barest amount of culture and education, but even for
a proper acquaintance with the Latin language itself.
Partly through its stiff and cumbrous immobility, partly
through the want of originality in its speakers, Latin
literature and Latin oratory were alike impossible without
the genial and fructifying influence of the Greek.
With Greek teachers and Greek models, a native literature
came into existence, and the language was artificially
trained to become a suitable instrument for communication
between the more polished nations of the ancient
world and their Roman masters. It is true that classical
Latin was really more or less of a hothouse exotic, interesting
therefore rather to the student of literature than
to the student of linguistic science; but the attempt to
rear and nurture it, to keep it unpolluted by the spoken
dialects of Rome or the provinces, and to confine it
within the rules and metres of a foreign rhythm made it
the seedplot of grammatical questions and philological
investigations. The study of grammar was of practical
importance to the practical Roman; he applied himself
to it with all the energy of his nature, and treated the
whole subject in a practical rather than a philosophical
way. Julius Cæsar, the type and impersonation of the
Roman spirit, found time to compose a work, “De
Analogiâ,” and invent the term <i>ablative</i>, amid the distractions
of political life, and even Cato with all his
dogged conservatism, learnt Greek in his old age in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
that he might be able to teach it to his son. The zeal
with which the deepest problems of grammar were
discussed seems strange to us of to-day, but upon the
settlement of these problems depended the possibility of
making Latin the vehicle of law and oratory, and preventing
the Roman world from becoming Greek.</p>

<p>The first school grammar ever written in Europe was
the Greek grammar of Dionysius Thrax, a pupil of Aristarchus,
which he published at Rome in the time of Pompey.
The grammar is still in existence,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and its opening sentence,
in which grammar is defined as “a practical acquaintance”
with the language of literary men, and divided
into six parts—accentuation and phonology, explanation
of figurative expressions, definition, etymology, general
rules of flection, and critical canons<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>—has formed the
starting-point of the innumerable school-grammars which
have since seen the light. It has also been the cause of
much of that absurd etymologizing which the Romans
received from the Greeks and handed on to the lexicographers
of modern Europe. Not content with transcribing
the grotesque etymologies of their Greek teachers, the
Latin writers strove to emulate them by still more grotesque
etymologies of their own. Lucius Ælius Stilo, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Lanuvium, about 100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> first gave a course of lectures
on Latin literature and rhetoric, and one of his pupils,
Marcus Terentius Varro, wrote five books, “De Linguâ
Latinâ,” which he dedicated to his friend Cicero. The
“science” of Latin etymology was now founded, and a
fruitful field opened to future explorers. Every word had
to be provided with a derivation, and on the received
principles of etymology this was no difficult task. By the
law of <i>antiphrasis</i>, <i>bellum</i> is made the neuter of <i>bellus</i>,
“because there is <i>nothing</i> beautiful in war;” and <i>parcus</i>
is so named because the niggard “spares (<i>parcere</i>) nobody.”
It has been left to the vagaries of a later day to
excel the Romans in this part of their labours. The
lawyers tell us that <i>parliament</i> is derived from <i>parler</i>,
“to speak,” <i>mentem</i>, “one’s mind;” Junius<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
<i>soul</i> is “the well of life” from the Greek ζάω, “to live,”
and the Teutonic <i>wala</i>, “well,” while <i>merry</i> comes from
μυρίζειν, because the ancients anointed themselves at feasts;
and a book entitled “Ereuna,” published as late as
the year of grace 1875, would raise the envy of a Latin
etymologist. When we find Jupiter (Diespiter) gravely
derived in it from the “Celtic” <i>oyo-meir</i>, “infinite,” and
<i>peitir</i>, “a thunderbolt;” <i>Nemesis</i> discovered to be the
“Celtic” <i>neam-aire</i>, “pitiless,” and <i>manna man-neam</i>,
“food of heaven”—we may trace the last results of that
unhappy disease of “popular etymologizing” which it is
the work of comparative philology to cure.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>The introduction of Greek grammar into Rome, however,
was attended by another evil than the propagation
of a false system of etymology. The technical terms of
Greek grammar were in many cases misunderstood, and,
accordingly, mistranslated. Thus, in the province of phonology,
the mutes were divided into the ψιλά (<i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i>), and
their corresponding “rough” or aspirated sounds (δασέα),
the soft <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>b</i> being placed between the ψιλά and δασέα,
and consequently named μέσα, or “middle.” The Romans
rendered μέσα by <i>mediæ</i>, and δασέα by <i>aspiratæ</i>, but ψιλά
they mistranslated <i>tenues</i>, and the mistranslation still
causes confusion in modern treatises on pronunciation.
Similarly, <i>genitivus</i>, the “genitive” or case of “origin,” is
a blundering misrepresentation of the Greek γενική, or case
of “the genus,” a wholly different conception; and <i>accusativus</i>,
“the accusative,” or case “of accusing,” perpetuates
the mistake which saw in the Greek αἰτιατική a derivative
from αἰτιάομαι, to “blame,” instead of αἰτία, “an
object;” while the Greek ἀπαρέμφατος signifies “without a
secondary meaning” of tense or person, and not “the indefinite”
or “indetermining” as the Latin <i>infinitivus</i>
would imply. We still suffer from the errors made in
transferring to Rome the grammatical terminology of
Alexandria.</p>

<p>The Romans continued to take an interest in questions
of grammar and of etymology down to the last. It is
true that they confined their inquiries to their own and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the Greek language; the descent they claimed from
Æneas and the Trojans inspired them with no desire to
investigate the dialects of Asia, and even the Etruscan
language and literature which lingered on almost to the
Christian era at their own doors, were left unregarded by
the leading philologists of Rome. In language, as in
everything else, the provincial had to adapt himself to
the prejudices of his conqueror. Never before or since
has the principle of centralization been carried out with
greater logical precision. Even Cæsar who found time
to discuss grammatical questions in the midst of his
campaigns in Gaul, never troubled himself to examine
the language of his Gallic adversaries, or to compare the
grammatical forms they used with those of Latin.</p>

<p>Passing by the Emperor Claudius, who endeavoured to
reform the Roman alphabet, and actually introduced
three new letters, we come to Apollonius Dyskolus and
his son Herodian, two eminent Alexandrine grammarians
of the second century. We possess part of the “Syntax”
of the former, who specially devoted himself to this
branch of the subject, and expressed himself so briefly
and technically (like the grammarians of ancient India)
as to gain the name of Dyskolos, “the Difficult.” His
son Herodian continued the labours of his father, and in
the works of these Græco-Roman grammarians we see
the long controversy between the Analogists and the
Anomalists finally settled. Analogy is recognized as the
principle that underlies language; but in actual speech
exceptions occur to every rule, and break through the
hard-and-fast lines of artificial pedantry. The Greek and
Latin school-grammars of our boyhood are the heritage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
that has come down to us from this old dispute and its
final settlement. Dr. Jolly remarks with justice<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that the
radical fault of these grammatical labours was the confusion
between thinking and speaking, between logic and
grammar—a confusion which intruded the empirical
terminology of formal logic into grammar, and was only
dissipated when an investigation of the languages of the
East introduced the comparative method into the treatment
of speech, and showed that to interpret aright the
phænomena of Greek and Latin we must study them in
the light of other tongues.</p>

<p>The tradition handed down by Herodian was taken
up by Ælius Donatus in the fourth century, and Priscian
in the sixth; the former the author of the Latin grammar
which dominated the schools of the Middle Ages;
the latter of eighteen books on grammar, the most extensive
work of the kind we have received from classical
antiquity. Priscian flourished at Constantinople during
the short revival of the Roman Empire and glory that
marked the reign of Justinian; and one of the most
noticeable things in his writings is his comparison of
Latin with Greek, especially the Æolic dialect. In this
he followed Tyrannio or Diokles, the manumitted slave
of Cicero’s wife and the author of a treatise “On the
Derivation of the Latin Language from the Greek.”
Donatus and Priscian were the philological lights of
Europe for more than a thousand years, and such lights
were little better than darkness. Once, and once only,
was an attempt made to break down their monopoly and
to introduce oriental learning into Western education.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Pope Clement V., at the Council of Vienne in 1311, exhorted
the four great Universities of Europe—Paris,
Bologna, Salamanca, and Oxford—to establish two Chairs
of Hebrew, two of Arabic, and two of Chaldee, in order
that their students might be able to dispute successfully
with Jews and Mohammedans. About the same time
Dante, in his treatise “De Vulgari Eloquentiâ,” compared
the dialects of Italy, and selected one which he calls
“Illustrious, Cardinal and Courtly,” spoken wherever
education and refinement were to be found, and sprung
from the brilliant Sicilian court of Frederick II.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>—a dialect
destined to become the language of the “Divina
Commedia” and the nursing-mother of the languages and
literatures of modern Europe. But elsewhere the “Doctrinale
puerorum” of the priest Alexander de Villa Dei,
or Villedieu, of Paris, written in leonine verses, was the
sole grammar taught and learnt; and the Latin dictionary
of Giovanni de Balbis, of Genoa, was the only guide to
Latin literature. No wonder that Roger Bacon, in his
“Opus Majus,”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> has to lay down that Greek, Hebrew,
and Latin are three separate and independent languages,
which must be learned and treated separately and independently,
and that “those words only which are derived
from Greek and Hebrew ought to be interpreted by
those tongues, since those which are purely Latin cannot
be explained except by Latin words.” “For,” he goes on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to say, “Latin pure and simple is quite different from
every other language, and therefore cannot be interpreted
from any other.” The most approved scholars and etymologists
of his day amused themselves by deriving
<i>amen</i> from the Latin <i>a</i>, “without,” and the Greek <i>mene</i>
(? μείων), “defect,” <i>parascene</i> (<i>parasceve</i>) from the Latin
<i>parare</i> and <i>cæna</i>, and <i>cælum</i> from the hybrid <i>case-helios</i>,
or “house of the sun” (!), much in the same way that Jacobus
de Voragine, the genial author of the “Legenda
Aurea,”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> derives Clemens from “cleos, quod est gloria,
et mens, quasi gloriosa mens;” and says of the name
Cæcilia, “quasi <i>cæli lilia</i>, vel <i>cæcis via</i>, vel a <i>cælo</i> et <i>lya</i>:
vel Cæcilia quasi <i>cæcitate carens</i>; vel dicitur a <i>cælo</i> et <i>leos</i>
quod est populus.”</p>

<p>But even the older Humanists were not much better.
They knelt before the spirit of classical antiquity with a
worship at once child-like and unreasoning. Their object
was to write and speak Latin correctly—that is to say, in
accordance with the usage of certain literary men of
Rome, not to discover the grounds on which this usage
rested. Switheim declares that it matters as little to
know why this or that verb governs a case, as it does to
know why <i>bin</i>, the Latin <i>sum</i>, “governs the nominative,
<i>ich</i>, <i>ego</i>.” “We can say that the verb governs the
nominative, because it was once so agreed among the
grammarians of antiquity that the verb should govern
the nominative <i>ante se</i>. If it had been agreed among the
ancients that the object of the verb should be in the
accusative, the verb would govern the accusative.” The
grammatical term “to govern” was, by the way, a legacy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
bequeathed by the schoolmen; and a very mischievous
legacy it was. Priscian does not yet know it, though it
is found in Consentius. Unreasoning and unreasonable,
however, as the Humanists were in their treatment of
grammar, they were outdone by the orthodox who found
in the “errors” of the Vulgate—such as <i>Da mihi bibere</i>—direct
proofs of Divine inspiration, and the power of the
Holy Spirit to override the usual rules of grammar.
Johannes de Gallandia, for instance, states boldly:—“Pagina
divina non vult se subdere legi Grammatices,
nec vult illius arte regi.” So, again, Smaragdus writes in
reference to the rule laid down by Donatus, that <i>scalæ</i>,
<i>scopæ</i>, <i>quadrigæ</i> must be used in the plural: “We shall
not follow him because we know that the Holy Spirit has
always (namely, in the Vulgate) employed these words in
the singular.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that a knowledge of more than one
language is an indispensable preliminary to the formation
of a grammar of either; we have seen also that it was
among the Semites of Babylonia and Assyria that the
earliest grammatical essays were first made. The impulse
given to grammatical studies by these attempts did not
survive the fall of Babylon; and though the Jewish
schools in Babylonia and elsewhere were forced to accompany
the extinct Hebrew of their sacred books with
glosses and commentaries in Aramaic, they produced
nothing that can be called with any truth a grammatical
work. It was not until the foundation of the School of
Edessa, in the sixth century, that the traditions of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
scribes of Assur-bani-pal were taken up by their successors
in Mesopotamia. The study of Greek for ecclesiastical
purposes among the Syrian Christians led to the
compilation of a Syrian grammar; and Jacob of Edessa
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 650-700) succeeded in elaborating one which served
as a model for all succeeding works. His whole grammar,
however, was based on that of the Greeks, and his terminology
was either borrowed directly from the Greek, or
formed after the analogy of his Greek originals. Jacob,
to whom the systematization of the Syriac vowel-points
is to be ascribed, was followed by Elias of Nisibis
(eleventh century), and John Barzugbi (thirteenth century),
who, says M. Renan, “may be regarded as the
author of the first complete grammar of the Syriac language.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The Arabs were not slow to imitate the example
of their Syrian neighbours. The preservation of
the text of the Korân turned their attention to philological
studies at an early period; and we may assign the
real foundation of Arabic grammar to the end of the
seventh century, when Abul-Aswed (who died 688 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>)
introduced the diacritical points and vowel-signs, and
wrote some treatises on several questions of grammar.
His labours were continued in the schools of Basra and
Kufa, and Sibawaih (770), the oldest grammarian whose
works have come down to us, shows us Arabic grammar
almost complete. His successors, as M. Renan remarks,
did little more than fill out the details of his teaching;
and in the fifteenth century, Suyuthi knows of no less
than 2,500 grammarians who had made a name in Arabic
literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>With Syriac and Arabic grammars thus formed, and
the doctrine of triliteral roots enunciated, all that was
wanting was to work out a comparative grammar of the
Semitic dialects. Just as the grammarians of Greece and
Rome had perceived the connection that existed between
the two languages, and in their haphazard and arbitrary
fashion had endeavoured to trace the origin of Latin
words to Greek sources, so the relationship between the
Semitic idioms could not but be detected as soon as
serious labours were commenced upon them; and the
closeness of this relationship prevented the errors and absurdities
into which the classical grammarians were betrayed
by their ignorance of other tongues. To the Jews
belongs the merit of first formulating what we may term
a comparative grammar. The Saboreans and Masoretes
in the sixth century did for the Old Testament what the
Alexandrine Greeks had done for Homer, the Arabs for
the Korân, and the Hindus for the Veda; and in the
tenth century a Hebrew grammar was founded under
Arabic influence, and with it a comparative grammar of
the Semitic languages. The Jews, who had warmly received
Mohammedan culture, and even become intermediaries
between their Arabic masters and the “infidel”
philosophy of Greece, were necessarily bilingual; and the
first fruits of this necessity were the grammatical works
of the Gaon, Saadia-el-Fayyumi (who died 942). After
Saadia came Menahem-ben-Seruk of Tortosa (960), and
Dunash-ben-Librât of Fez (970), who composed the first
works on Hebrew lexicography, and of whom the latter
declares that he “compares the relation of Arabic and
Hebrew, counts all the genuine words of Arabic which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
are found in Hebrew, and points out that Hebrew is pure
Arabic.” About the same time Judah Khayyug of Fez
gave an exhaustive account of defective roots and the
permutation of servile letters, while Jonah ben Gannach
of Cordova (in Arabic Abul Walid Mervan-ibn-Janah),
in the eleventh century, completed the grammatical
labours of his predecessors.</p>

<p>With the decline of Arabic supremacy and the introduction
of Neo-Hebrew arose a new school of Hebrew
philology, of which the Kimchi of Narbonne (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1200)
are the leading representatives. This school was less
comparative than the foregoing, and the rabbinical spirit
that prevailed in it, though conducing to minute accuracy,
was not favourable to philological progress. It was, however,
the instructor of the Christian scholars of the Renaissance,
whose zeal for knowledge and learning brought
the study of Hebrew and its cognate languages within
the circle of European thought. The Reformation, breaking
as it did with the mediæval Church, and making its
appeal to the Scriptures themselves, made a knowledge
of the original language of the Old Testament indispensable.
Christian scholars like Reuchlin, the two Buxtorfs,
Richard Simon, Ludolf, Schultens, or our own Castell
and Pococke, devoted themselves to a study of Semitic
philology with the same energy and success as men like
the Stephenses, the Scaligers, and the Vosses to a study
of classical philology. Lexicons and grammars were
compiled, texts were critically examined and edited, and
a comparative dictionary of the Semitic languages was
brought out. It was inevitable that men who were at
once masters of Hebrew and Greek should discover resemblances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and coincidences between the two languages.
Hebrew grammar was cast into a classical mould, and
Latin and Greek words were derived from Hebrew roots.
Hebrew, it was argued, was the sacred language which
had been spoken by Adam and the patriarchs, since the
names of our first parents and their offspring are of Hebrew
origin; and it was therefore clear that Hebrew
must have been the primæval speech used before the
confusion of tongues at Babel, the primitive source from
which the manifold dialects of the world have been derived.
A new etymological system accordingly sprang
up, quite as grotesque in its rules and its results as the
old etymological system of Greece and Rome; and dictionaries
of Latin and English appeared in which every
word was provided with its Hebrew original.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Since
Hebrew is written from right to left, it was assumed that
a Hebrew root could be read the reverse way if a satisfactory
etymology was not otherwise forthcoming; and
as the profane languages might be expected to retain
some reminiscences of their sacred mother, a similar procedure
was adopted to connect words in English and the
classical tongues with one another, and so <i>stum</i> was
proved to come from the Latin <i>mustum</i>, and the Latin
<i>forma</i> from the Greek μορφή. It was not the only instance
in which theological prepossessions have injured the
cause of philology.</p>

<p>With Herder and Lessing, however, a new era of
thought and philosophy began. The mechanical explanation
of the world was superseded by a psychological
one; the idea of development took the place of the idea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
of contract and convention. Herder devoted a special
treatise to the “Ideal of Speech,”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and a prize offered by
the Berlin Academy for the best essay on “the Ideal of
a Perfect Language,” was won by Jenisch in 1796. The
work of Jenisch bore the ambitious title, “A philosophico-critical
Comparison and Estimate of Fourteen of the
Ancient and Modern Languages of Europe, viz., Greek,
Latin, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, English,
German, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Polish, Russian,
Lithuanian.” But Jenisch was still under the dominion
of the assumption which made the Roman jurist discover
his <i>jus gentium</i> in those points in which the laws of different
nations agreed; he finds the ideal of a perfect language
in the fourteen languages of his title, all deviations
from their grammar being characterized as “less perfect
formations.” Richness in the vocabulary, expressiveness,
clearness, and euphony are the four marks of superiority.
The value of Jenisch’s lucubrations, however, may be
judged from his statement that the Greek case-endings
were probably modelled after those of Hebrew. It
needed the genius of Herder to recognize that the language
of a people is but the expression of its spiritual
life, and to lay down in his “Ideen” (1785) that “in
each language the understanding and character of its
speakers reflects itself.” A step forward was made by
Mahn in his “Representation of Lexicography from
every Point of View,” published in 1817. In this (p. 264)
he divides the history of speech into three periods corresponding
with the periods in the life of the individual—childhood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
youth, and age—severally distinguished by
memory, imagination, and intellect. The first period is
that in which language was formed, the second that in
which it was perfected, the third that in which it was
made logical.</p>

<p>If language is logical it is evident that the categories
of grammar ought to correspond with the categories of
logic, and attempts were accordingly made to sketch the
outlines of a universal grammar. In 1801 Vater brought
out his “Versuch einer allgemeinen Sprachlehre,” with
an introduction on the nature and origin of speech, and
an appendix on the adaptation of the rules of universal
grammar to those of the grammars of individual tongues.
But Vater chose “the high <i>priori</i> road;” he assumed that
the first men spoke in accordance with the forms of logic,
and instead of tracing the history of grammar in the
records of living speech, made that alone normal and
correct which seemed to himself to be so. This work of
Vater’s was followed, three years later, by a translation
of De Sacy’s “Axioms of Universal Philology,” and in
1805 by a “Lehrbuch allgemeiner Grammatik.” Comparative
grammar is defined as a setting side by side of
the forms of different languages for the sake of reaching
that which is “common” to them; but this definition is
only scientific in appearance; what is “common” turns
out to be not the original forms of a parent-speech, but
the forms which a philosopher of the eighteenth century
believed to lie at the bottom of “universal grammar.”</p>

<p>This idea of a universal grammar was due partly to
the influence of an age which believed the ultimate
analyses of logic to represent the thoughts of primitive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
man, partly to the unmethodical comparison of a variety
of languages, some ancient, some modern, and some as
unrelated to one another as Greek and Hebrew. But it
was also in some measure the result of a revived study
of the old Greek theories about language. Our countryman
James Harris led the way with his “Hermes, or a
Philosophical Enquiry concerning Universal Grammar”
(1765). The work was an important one, for it not
only stimulated an interest in linguistic studies, but
also recalled attention to the labours of those who
had built up the framework of our school grammars.
Harris was succeeded by Horne Tooke, whose “Diversions
of Purley,” however imperfect and erroneous
from the point of view of modern scientific philology,
threw a charm over what had hitherto seemed repulsive
inquiries into the words and forms of speech, and laid
down the axiom that we must first investigate the older
forms of a language before we can determine the origin
and nature of their later equivalents. But Horne Tooke’s
work was composed in the interests of a philosophical
theory, and its keynote is struck in the assertion that
<i>truth</i> is that which a man <i>troweth</i>. Things are but the
reflection of words, and words are what men deliberately
make them. Grammar is no organic growth, but the
mechanical invention of mankind. And just as the first
men framed it in ignorance and imperfection, so the philosophers
of the eighteenth century could reframe it
according to the requirements of formal logic. It was
the old mistake of the Greek Analogists over again, only
with the difference that they thought of the grammar of
a single language alone, whereas the more ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
philologists of the “Aufklärung” aimed at producing a
grammar which would be applicable to all tongues.</p>

<p>The French Encyclopædia was the manifesto of the
“Aufklärung,” and the Encyclopædia devoted six of its
volumes to grammar and literature. Grammar is divided
into general and particular, and while general grammar
is defined as “la science raisonnée des principes immuables
et généraux de la parole prononcée ou écrite dans
toutes les langues,” particular grammar is defined as
“the art of applying to the immutable and general
principles of the word whether pronounced or written
the arbitrary and customary usages (<i>institutions</i>)
of a special language.” In accordance with the lines
thus traced out, Gottfried Hermann, in 1801, published
his work, “De emendendâ ratione Græcæ Grammaticæ,”
and G. M. Roth brought out his “Antihermes, or Philosophical
Researches into the pure apprehension of
Human Speech and Universal Philology” in 1795, and
his “Outlines of pure Universal Philology for the use of
Academies and advanced classes in the Gymnasia” in
1815. As yet neither families of speech nor the morphology
of language were even dreamt of; and the
“principles” derived from the school grammars of Greece
and Rome, supplemented by the categories of modern
philosophical systems, were supposed to apply to all
languages alike. It was reserved for A. F. Bernhardi, the
pupil of F. A. Wolf and Fichte, the friend of Tieck and
Schlegel, to approach towards a truer conception of the
nature and relationship of speech in his “Sprachlehre,”
which he dedicated to his master Wolf. The first part
of this work appeared at Berlin in 1801, under the title<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of “Reine Sprachlehre,” the second part, “Angewandte
Sprachlehre,” being published in 1803, and the third
part, “Anfangsgründe der Sprachwissenschaft,” in 1805.
Bernhardi first caught sight of the fact that whereas,
from a purely scientific point of view, the grammar of
every language follows its own independent and peculiar
line, for practical purposes we must dwell mainly upon
those particulars in which it agrees with the grammars
of other tongues.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> According to Haym his book was
“the first entrance of the spirit of the romantic movement
into the sphere of real science.” Language is defined
“as an allegory of the understanding, which expresses
and represents itself, according to its inherent
nature, through this externalization.” Hence a connection
is sought between the sound and the thing signified;
the initial liquid of <i>light</i>, for instance, indicates the sense
of the word, whether used as a substantive or as an adjective.
In the second part of his work Bernhardi discusses
the relation of language to poetry on the one side,
and to science on the other, and, as might have been expected
from his definition of it as an allegory, regards it
as being in its very essence the lyrical utterance of the
primitive poet.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the etymologists went on with their work
of random guessing, with little heed to the labours of
continental scholars upon a philosophy of grammar. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
this country Dr. Murray’s “History of the European
Languages” was posthumously published in 1823, in
which he holds that all the manifold languages of the
world are derived from a single primeval one which
consisted of a few monosyllables, AG or WAG being the
first articulate sound. To this primeval language the
Teutonic, and not the Hebrew, “comes nearest;” and it
is only fair to say that the relationship of Sanskrit and
Persian to the Aryan dialects of Europe is recognized, and
a full account given of the ancient Indian speech. In an
appendix Dr. Murray also pointed out what we should
now term the Aryan affinities of the Scythian words
preserved by the classical authors. But his principles of
etymology were the same as those of the Greeks; similarity
of sound was sufficient to prove identity of origin.
And every word, from whatever quarter it may be
gathered, is forced to become a proof or an example of
the descent of language from his nine monosyllabic interjections.
A volume, published in 1800 by W. Whiter,
under the ambitious title of “Etymologicum Magnum,
or Universal Etymological Dictionary,” is not content
even with the limits prescribed to himself by Dr. Murray.
English, Greek, Latin, French, Irish, Welsh, Slavonic,
Hebrew, Arabic, Gipsey, Coptic, and many more, are all
mixed up together with the most impartial prodigality.
The character of the work may be judged of by the assertion
of the writer, “that from a hord of vagrant Gipsies
once issued that band of sturdy robbers—the companions
of Romulus and Remus;” this being based on the fact
that the Gipsies “are in their own language called
Romans, or Romani.” After this we need not be surprised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
at being told that the English <i>give</i> and <i>shaft</i>, the
Hebrew <i>gabbe</i> (<i>sic</i>), the Chaldee <i>gavav</i>, the French <i>javeau</i>,
the German <i>garbe</i>, and the Latin <i>sparum</i>, have all one
and the same origin; or that <i>sepulcrum</i> is derived from
the Hebrew <i>kabar</i>, “to bury,” and the Celtic <i>pen</i> from the
Hebrew <i>phânâh</i>, “to incline.”</p>

<p>What has been termed the discovery of Sanskrit by
Western scholars put an end to all this fanciful playing
with words and created the science of language. The
native grammarians of India had at an early period
analyzed both the phonetic sounds and the vocabulary of
Sanskrit with astonishing precision, and drawn up a far
more scientific system of grammar than the philologists
of Alexandria or Rome had been able to attain. The
Devanâgari alphabet is a splendid monument of phonological
accuracy, and long before the time of Saadia and
Khayyug, the Hindu “Vaiyâkaranas,” or grammarians,
had not only discovered that roots are the ultimate elements
of language, but had traced all the words of Sanskrit
to a limited number of roots. Their grammatical
system and nomenclature rest upon a firm foundation of
inductive reasoning, and though based on the phænomena
of a single language, show a scientific insight into
the nature of speech which has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>It is possible that the democratic movement of Buddhism
which broke down caste and raised the inferior
dialects and languages of India to the same level as the
sacred Sanskrit of the Veda, had much to do with
the extraordinary success of the Hindu grammarians.
The immediate object of their investigation was the
language of the Rig-Veda, which had become obscure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and partly obsolete through the changes wrought by
time upon the spoken tongue. The Rig-Veda, pre-eminently
called “<i>the</i> Veda,” is a collection of hymns
and poems of various dates, some of which go back to
the earliest days of the Aryan invasion of north-western
India; the whole collection, however, may be roughly
ascribed to at least the fourteenth or fifteenth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
In course of time it came to assume a sacred character,
and the theory of inspiration invented to support this
goes much beyond the most extreme theory of verbal
inspiration ever held in the Jewish or the Christian
Church. The Rig-Veda was divided into ten <i>mandalas</i>
or books, each <i>mandala</i> being assigned to some old
family; and out of these were formed three new Vedas—the
Yajur, the Sâma, and the Âtharva. The Yajur and
the Sâma may be described as prayer-books compiled
from the Rig for the use of the choristers and the
ministers of the priests, and contain little besides what
is found in the earliest and most sacred Veda. Along
with the latter they sometimes go under the name of the
Trayî or “Triad,” a name which implies that the Âtharva-Veda
was not yet in existence when it was given. In
fact, the Âtharva<i>n</i>a may be described as a collection of
poems mixed up with popular sayings, medical advice,
magical formulæ, and the like. It was assigned to the
Brahman or fourth class of priests, who superintended
the ritual, just as the Sâma-Veda was assigned to the
choristers, the Yajur-Veda to the acolytes, to whom the
manual work involved in a sacrifice was delegated, and
the Rig-Veda to the Hotri, or priest proper, who had to
recite portions of it, whence its name of Rig, or “Praise.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
The period that must have elapsed before the hymns of
the Rig could have been collected together, invested
with a sacred character, and elaborated into a ritual, must
have been considerable; but not until this was done, and
the three supplementary Vedas composed, was the whole
Veda or depository of sacred “knowledge” complete.
At a later date came the Brâhmanas, or commentaries on
the Veda, the object of which was to explain obscure
passages in the old hymns, and the erroneous and absurd
explanations sometimes offered show pretty plainly how
much both the language and the ideas of the people had
changed. The sacredness of the Veda was reflected upon
the Brâhmanas themselves, and a time came when they
too began to be regarded as divine, and to be superseded
by the Sûtras, the “strings” or manuals of the grammarians.
The diffuse style of the Brâhmanas made way for
the scientific brevity of the Sûtras, and Hindu literature
entered upon its Alexandrine stage. Even the grammar of
the Brâhmanas became archaic; and accordingly, though
the Veda was the primary object of the grammarians’
labours, the Brâhmanas also had a share in their regard.
The Sûtras endeavour to explain the Veda and all connected
with it—a principal part of their work being
naturally an explanation of the Vedic language and
grammar. But, before this could be effected, an accurate
register of the facts was required, and the Masoretes of
India accordingly divided and counted, not only the
verses and words, but even the syllables of the Rig-Veda.
According to Śaunaka, the teacher of Kâtyâyana, the
1,028 hymns of the Rig-Veda contain 10,616 (or 10,622)
verses, 153,826 words (<i>padas</i>), and 432,000 syllables,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
eleven of the hymns being of later date than the rest;
and since the number of syllables and words given by
Śaunaka is the number found in our present texts, it is
clear that the Rig-Veda has been handed down, from the
sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to our own day, with the most perfect
precision. This is the more astonishing at first sight,
from its being handed down orally alone; but the labours
of Śaunaka and his brother scholars had much to do with
the result. The numbering of the syllables of the
Veda led to the formation of the so-called Pada-text, in
which the single words are divided one from another,
instead of being run together in accordance with the laws
of Sandhi. These laws require that the final letter of a
word should be modified by the initial letter of the word
that follows, the consequence being that two separate
syllables (as in <i>tad śrutwâ</i>, “having heard that”) are
made to coalesce into one (<i>tachchhrutwâ</i>). To resolve
these amalgamated syllables was to discover the phonetic
rules and principles which regulated the pronunciation
of Sanskrit, and to lay the foundation of a scientific
phonology.</p>

<p>But a more important work remained behind. Kautsa,
a grammarian of the fifth or sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, tells us
that the language of the Rig-Veda had by that time
become so obsolete as to be understood with difficulty,
and yet the exact recital of the hymns had come to be
regarded as indispensable for the performance of religious
service. The Prâtiśâkhyas, the oldest production of the
grammatical school, show a surprising acquaintance with
the physiological facts of phonetic utterance, and far
surpass the most advanced labours of the Greeks in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
same direction. The Nighantavas, a little later, contain
a list of rare Vedic words, and perhaps started the controversy
which broke out shortly afterwards among the
grammarians as to the origin of the nouns. Śâka<i>t</i>âyana
and his followers, the Nairuktas, or Etymologists, maintained
that they were all derived from verbs; while his
opponents, Gârgya and others, called the Vaiyâkaranas
or Analyzers, sought to show that some at least had a
different origin. In the end, however, the party of
Śâka<i>t</i>âyana proved victorious, and the result was not
only the formation of the Sanskrit dictionary, but, what
was far more important, the clear enunciation of the
doctrine of roots. In the hands of Yâska and Pânini the
doctrine became fruitful in consequences; the classical language
of India was thoroughly analyzed, and the essential
part of each word marked off from its formative suffixes.
In short, a scientific grammar was created. The <i>Nirukta</i>,
or “Etymology,” of Yâska is a model of method and
conciseness, though it is thrown into the shade by the
grammar of Pânini. This was the crowning work of the
Hindu grammarians, and, composed as it was in the
fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, may well excite our astonishment and
admiration. In eight books, and about 4,000 short rules,
it sums up the principles of Sanskrit phonology, the
declension of the noun and the conjugation of the verb
(which agree in the main with those worked out by the
Greek grammarians), the nature of the adverbs and other
particles, the rules of syntax, which are interspersed
among the various divisions of the accidence, the etymology
of words, with an exhaustive list of “primary”
and “secondary” formative suffixes, and a minute analysis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
of composition which has been the basis of modern
attempts to deal with this intricate subject. As an
appendix to his Grammar, Pânini also compiled a list
of roots (<i>dhâtus</i>, or “elements”), amounting in all to
about 1,700.</p>

<p>The brevity and compactness of the work was much
aided by the algebraic system of symbols by which the
various terms of grammar were expressed. Thus, in
Pânini, a verbal termination is denoted by <i>l</i>, the endings
of the primary tenses by <i>lt</i>, those of the secondary tenses
by <i>ln</i>, the special tenses and moods being pointed out by
an inserted vowel, as <i>lât</i> for the present, <i>lot</i> for the imperative,
and so on. The mathematical character of
this device shows the precision with which the several
rules of grammar had been ascertained and laid down,
as well as the instinctive recognition that there was a
science of grammar as well as a science of mathematics.
It only remained for a later generation of Western
scholars to demonstrate that such was really the case.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that this later generation was so
long in coming. Already, at the end of the sixteenth
century, an Italian, Philippo Sassetti, during a five years’
residence in India, had made himself acquainted with
Sanskrit, and drew attention to the likeness between the
Sanskrit numerals and other words and corresponding
words in his native language.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Another Italian, Roberto
de Nobili, who went to India in 1606 as a missionary,
actually transformed himself into a Brahman, in order to
win over the Hindus; and after acquiring a knowledge
not only of Tamil and Telugu, but also of Sanskrit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
“showed himself in public, dressed in the proper garb of
the Brahmans, wearing their cord and their frontal mark,
observing their diet, and submitting even to the complicated
rules of caste.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> One of his converts—so at least
Professor Max Müller thinks—composed the curious
Ezur, or fourth Veda, which professes to be a lost Veda
that he came to preach, and “contains a wild mixture of
Hindu and Christian doctrine.” Fifty years after De
Nobili a German missionary, named Heinrich Roth, was
able to dispute in Sanskrit with the Brahmans, and in
1740 a Frenchman, Père Pons, sent home a comprehensive
and fairly accurate report upon Sanskrit literature.
It was not till 1790, however, that the first Sanskrit
grammar was published in Europe, at Rome, by two
German friars, Hanxleden and Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomeo,
whose real name was Philipp Wesdin. Some
years before (in 1767) the Frenchmen Cœurdoux and
Barthélemy had written from Pondicherry to the Academy
to express their opinion that a relationship existed
between the vocabularies of Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin,
and to prove that this relationship could not be accounted
for by the hypothesis of borrowing. Their letter, however,
though read in 1768, was not printed until 1808,
after the death of Anquetil-Duperron, and at the end of
one of his Mémoires. Meanwhile English and German
scholars had entered the field, and the opinion expressed
by the French missionaries had become a belief of the
learned world.</p>

<p>In 1784 the Asiatic Society was founded at Calcutta,
and its first members did their utmost to extend a knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
of the Sanskrit language and literature. Halhed,
in the preface to his “Grammar of Bengali,” published in
1778, had noticed the “similitude of Sanskrit words with
those of Persian and Arabic, and even of Latin and
Greek;” and Sir William Jones,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> addressing the Asiatic
Society at Calcutta in 1786, states that “no philologer
could examine the Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, without
believing them to have sprung from some common source
which, perhaps, no longer exists. There is a similar
reason,” he goes on to say, “though not quite so forcible,
for supposing that both the Gothic and Celtic had the
same origin with the Sanskrit. The old Persian may be
added to the same family.”</p>

<p>Here, then, was the great discovery made. It required
a man like Sir William Jones, who united the tastes of
the poet and <i>littérateur</i> with those of the linguistic scholar
to overcome the prejudices of a classical education, and
to admit that the languages of Greece and Rome had the
same origin as the languages of the despised Hindu. It
required still greater insight and sobriety to trace them
all from a common source, rather than to magnify the
newly acquired Oriental speech by making it the parent
of the languages of the West; and though we may now
smile at his attempt to explain classical mythology by
comparing its personages with Indian deities with similarly
sounding names, Sir William Jones deserves to be
remembered as the pioneer of comparative philology. He
stands out in honourable contrast to Dugald Stewart, the
Scotch philosopher of common sense, who, in absolute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
ignorance of even a single Sanskrit character, undertook
the task of proving that Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature
were alike the inventions of the Brahmans, and that they
were forged after the model of Greek and Latin in order
to deceive European scholars. It was not the first time
that philosophy and common sense have found themselves
opposed to unwelcome knowledge.</p>

<p>Lord Monboddo, Stewart’s fellow-countryman, showed
himself a sounder critic and a more unprejudiced inquirer.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
His friend, Wilkins, the translator of the “Bhagavadgîta”
and “Hitopadeśa,” and author of a Sanskrit
grammar, proved to his satisfaction that Sanskrit was
“a richer and in every respect a finer language than even
the Greek of Homer,” and that the likeness between
Sanskrit on the one side, and Greek and Latin on the
other, demonstrated the descent of all three from some
common primæval tongue. The Scotch judge accordingly
found a niche for the new discovery in his theory
which derived mankind from two tailless apes, and the
languages of the world from the Osirian language of
Egypt. Sanskrit, it was plain, had been introduced into
India by Osiris, just as Greek had been brought into the
Peloponnesus by the Pelasgians. Not only the numerals,
“the use of which must have been coeval with civil
society,” or the words of common life, but even the
grammatical forms of a verb like <i>asmi</i>, “I am,” are produced
in evidence of the relationship of the classical languages
of Europe and of India. As early as 1795 Lord
Monboddo was not far from the discovery of that Indo-European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
family of speech which has been the starting-point
and foundation of the science of language.</p>

<p>Both Sir William Jones and Lord Monboddo, however,
did no more than draw aside the curtain for a moment
and reveal the new world that lay behind. It was reserved
for Germany to accomplish what England had
begun. The genius of Leibniz had already prepared the
way by overthrowing the belief that Hebrew was the
original language from which all others are to be traced,
and by setting missionaries and others to work in compiling
vocabularies, grammars, and phrase-books of the
manifold dialects of the world. Thus, in thanking Witsen,
the Burgomaster of Amsterdam, for a translation of the
Lord’s Prayer into Hottentot, he writes: “Remember, I
implore you, and remind your Muscovite friends, to make
researches in order to procure specimens of the Scythian
languages, the Samoyedes, Siberians, Bashkirs, Kalmuks,
Tungusians, and others;” and his sound scientific instinct
makes him ask (in his “Dissertation on the Origin
of Nations,” 1710): “Why begin with the unknown instead
of the known? It stands to reason that we ought
to begin with studying the modern languages which are
within our reach, in order to compare them with one
another, to discover their differences and affinities, and
then to proceed to those which have preceded them in
former ages, in order to show their filiation and their
origin, and then to ascend, step by step, to the most
ancient tongues.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He found an illustrious convert in
Catherine of Russia, who once shut herself up for nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
a year in order to work at her “Comparative Dictionary
of Languages,” and the “Catalogo delle Lingue conosciute
e notizia della loro affinitá e diversitá” (1784) of
the Spanish Jesuit missionary, Don Lorenzo Hervas
and the “Mithridates” of Adelung and Vater are, as
Professor Max Müller has observed, plainly due to his
influence. The efforts of Leibniz were seconded in another
direction by those of Herder, to whom we may
trace the conception of a comparative treatment of literature
and a recognition of the merits of literary remains
beyond those of Greece and Rome. Herder, as has
already been remarked, made the rise of an historical
science possible by substituting the idea of development
for that of uniform sequence in history, and his treatise
on the “Origin of Speech,” crowned by the Berlin Academy
in 1772, dissipated for ever the theory that language
was a miraculous gift and not the slowly evolved
creation of the human mind. The German mind was
already prepared to seize and unfold the consequences
which resulted from the discovery of Sanskrit. It was a
poet, Friedrich Schlegel, however, and not a philologist,
who first laid down the great fact that the languages of
India, Persia, Greece, Italy, Germany, and Slavonia
form but one family, daughters of the same mother,
and heirs of the same wealth of words and flections.
Schlegel learnt Sanskrit while in England during the
peace of Amiens (1801-1802), and to his work on “The
Language and Wisdom of the Indians,” published in
1808, may be traced the foundation of the science of
language. All that was now required was some master-scholar
who should continue the work begun by Schlegel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
and establish on a deep and firm basis the edifice that
he had reared. This master-scholar was found in Francis
Bopp.</p>

<p>Bopp, the true founder of comparative philology,
made himself acquainted with Sanskrit during a visit to
England and the India House library, and in 1816 appeared
his famous work, “Das Conjugationssystem,” published
at Frankfurt, in which a minute and scientific
comparison was instituted between the grammatical systems
of Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Persian, and German.
It was not until 1833, however, that the first volume of
his “Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek,
Latin, Lithuanian, Slavonic, Gothic, and German” came
out, though several minor productions on Comparative
Philology had appeared meanwhile, and not until 1852
was the final volume of the Grammar completed. Bopp
was the author of the method which must be followed
by every student who pretends to a scientific treatment
of language; and though there is naturally much in his
work that has since needed revision, the main results at
which he arrived will always remain among the fundamental
truths of linguistic science. His Sanskrit grammars
were published in 1827, 1832, and 1834, and his
“Vergleichendes Accentuations-System,” published in
1854, not only pointed out the striking analogy between
the accentuation of Greek and Sanskrit, but also laid the
basis of all future inquiries into the subject. But even
Homer nods at times; and as if to warn us against following
too implicitly any leader, however illustrious, Bopp
sought to include the Polynesian dialects in his Indo-European
family, and thereby violated the very method<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
that he had himself inaugurated.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> His attempt to connect
the language of Georgia with the same family was
not more fortunate;<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and though Georgian is undoubtedly
inflectional in character, its flections are now known not
to be those of the Aryan group, nor its structure and
roots those which distinguish an Aryan tongue. Even
the errors of a great mind are instructive, and serve to
illustrate the soundness of the method which they violate.</p>

<p>Bopp’s work was confined to the more strictly scientific
and inductive side of comparative philology, to the comparison
of words and forms, and the conclusions we may
infer therefrom: the metaphysical side of the science
of language found an able expositor in Wilhelm von
Humboldt. Starting with the new method of Bopp,
Humboldt revised the old endeavours to found a philosophy
of speech, and extended the results obtained by
Bopp to all the manifold languages of the world. In a
number of publications, more especially the introduction
to his great work on the Kawi language of Java, which
came out after his death in 1836,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> he dealt with the
various problems raised by the science and philosophy
of language, and not only sketched the general outlines
of a true philosophy of speech, but also threw
out suggestions which have since borne abundant fruit
in the hands of other scholars. Humboldt’s work was
followed up by Steinthal, whose journal, the “Zeitschrift<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft,”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> conducted
with the help of Lazarus, has proved a treasury of
suggestive thought to a whole generation of linguistic
scholars. Bopp, on the other hand, was followed by Pott,
whose vast knowledge and genial insight are probably
unequalled among the students of language. His “Etymologische
Forschungen,” in spite of its size and want of
an adequate index, is a mine of philological wealth, and
his works on the “Language of the Gipsies” (1846), on
“Proper Names” (1856), and on the “Quinary and
Vigesimal Systems of Numeration” (1847), have largely
helped the progress of linguistic science. In the “Anti-Kaulen,”
or “Mythical Representations of the Origin of
Peoples and Languages” (1865), and “The Inequality of
the Races of Men” (1856), where a great display of anthropological
knowledge is made, Pott did good service
in checking the unifying haste of a young science.</p>

<p>While Humboldt and Pott were laying broad and
deep the foundations of the new science of language,
Jacob Grimm was applying the method of Bopp in
another and more special direction. Instead of endeavouring
to grasp the whole vast range of languages, or
even those of the Aryan group alone, he devoted himself
to the minute and scientific study of one branch of
them only, and his “Deutsche Grammatik” (1819-1837)
ushered in a new epoch in the history of comparative
philology. Benfey, indeed, still carried on with a master’s
power the labours begun by Bopp and Pott, but he too
had by degrees to adapt himself to the spirit of the
time, and the fame he has acquired as a Sanskrit scholar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
far outshines that acquired by his brilliant but ineffectual
attempt to reduce the Aryan and Semitic families
of speech to a single stem, or by his “History of the
study of Language and of Oriental Philology in Germany,
since the beginning of the sixteenth century”
(1869). The time was come for a microscopic rather
than a telescopic view of language and languages; the
broad outlines of linguistic science had been sketched
by its first founders, and what was now wanted was to
fill up the details, to apply the general principles of the
science to special cases, and, by a close and accurate
study of particular languages and dialects, either to
confirm or to overthrow the conclusions at which they
had arrived. No single man can know thoroughly more
than a few languages at the most; for the rest he must
be content to trust to the report of others; and however
great may be his genius, however wide-reaching his
vision, unless the materials he uses have already been
sifted and arranged in the light of the comparative
method, his most important inferences are likely to be
vitiated. Hence the value of the work begun by Grimm,
and of the direction in which he turned the course of
scientific philology. Erasmus Rask, the Dane, followed
up the example thus set with an investigation of the
northern languages of Europe, and his researches into
the language of the Zend-Avesta, the first ever undertaken
by an European scholar, formed the scaffold upon
which Eugène Burnouf erected the colossal structure of
Zend philology. Burnouf did for Zend and Achæmenian
Persian what Grimm had done for the Teutonic languages;
his work has been continued by Lassen, Haug,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Spiegel, Justi, and others. Meanwhile the Romance languages
were taken in hand by Diez, whose “Comparative
Grammar” (1836), and “Comparative Dictionary” (1853),<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
are masterpieces of method and insight. Indeed, they
may be said to have created Romance philology altogether.
The philology of the Keltic dialects was set on a
scientific footing by our own countryman, Prichard, and
above all by Zeuss and Stokes, while Miklosich and
Schleicher did the same for the Slavonic tongues. Along
with his special labours in Slavonic, Schleicher carried on
the tradition of a wider and more general treatment of
the whole Indo-European family itself, and his “Compendium
of Comparative Grammar” (1861-2), in which
he endeavoured to restore the grammar of the parent
Aryan speech, will ever remain a monument of learning
and genius. Schleicher also came forward as the representative
of the view which includes the science of
language among the physical sciences, and his works,
whatever may be thought of the theory that underlies
them, have done much to further the progress of linguistic
study.</p>

<p>Grimm and his school acted wisely and scientifically
in beginning with the modern languages whose phonology
and pronunciation, the skeleton of all real
linguistic science, can be fully known, and whose idioms,
the life-blood, as it were, of language, are still living and
familiar. But language, like all things else connected
with man and his mind, is a self-developing organism,
and as such must be studied historically. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
though the student of language must start with the
modern and living languages of the world, the older
languages which lie behind them are of infinite importance,
and to neglect them would be as fatal as for the
geologist to neglect the older strata of the earth. The
relics of ancient speech, preserved in the monuments of
Egypt or Assyria, or in the records of Greece and Rome,
are as precious as the fossils which enable the palæontologist
to trace the history of life upon the globe, and
the geologist to explain the origin and structure of the
existing rocks. The same method and minute investigation,
accordingly, which had effected so much for the
Romance and Teutonic dialects, were applied to the study
of the classical languages, and, in the hands of G. Curtius
and his school, Greek and Latin philology has been
revivified and illuminated, and made to yield stores of
precious facts to the comparative philologist. The old-fashioned
scholarship has become a thing of the past;
the various dialects of Italy and Greece have been restored
to their true place, and the death-blow given to
the system which derived Latin from Greek, or attempted
to explain the grammars of the two classical languages
by confounding the laws and phænomena peculiar to
each. The labours of Lobeck, of Gottfried Hermann, of
Passow, of Döderlein, and above all of Philipp Buttmann,
whose intuition frequently made him anticipate
the conclusions of later discovery, had furnished Curtius
with the basis on which the new superstructure might
be built, while Corssen, his fellow-labourer in the field of
Latin research, found that here also his predecessors had
gathered in an almost equal harvest of materials. Comparative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
philology has made it possible for the scientific
method to be learnt as well from the study of the classical
tongues as from the study of chemistry or geology.</p>

<p>The results acquired in the realm of the Aryan or Indo-European
languages served as a starting-point for the investigation
of other families of speech. For a long time
comparative philology remained practically synonymous
with the comparative treatment of the Aryan languages
only. But its method was equally applicable to the examination
of all other languages throughout the world,
and the general laws of language discovered by men like
Bopp and Grimm might be expected to hold good of all
languages and dialects whatsoever. Furnished with the
new scientific method and the principles upon which it was
based, scholars next attacked those Semitic languages
whose inflectional structure seemed to bring them into
such close contact with the languages of the Aryan
group. A new era was inaugurated in their study by the
labours of Gesenius, Ewald, and Olshausen; and Renan
even attempted a “Histoire générale et système comparé
des langues sémitiques.” But Renan’s work remains a
splendid fragment; the first part, the “Histoire Générale,”
has passed through several editions; but the “Système
comparé” has never appeared. It was soon found that
the comparative study of the Aryan languages would not
give the key to all the problems of speech; that in fact
the Aryan group was an exceptional one, and the laws
determined from it, so far from being of universal validity,
did not apply even to the dialects of the Semitic family.
The endeavour to reduce the Semitic radicals to monosyllabic
biliterals, under the belief that Aryan philology<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
necessitated the existence of monosyllabic roots in all languages,
introduced nothing but confusion into the study
of the Semitic tongues; and the theory of pronominal
suffixes, which seemed to be supported by the phænomena
of Aryan speech, has been equally a loss rather than a gain
for them. It is at last becoming recognized, however,
that each group of languages, as well as each language in
the several groups, has its own linguistic laws peculiar to
itself, and to apply these to other groups and languages
in which they have not been proved to exist, is to do
violence to the comparative method itself. The Aryan
languages are the languages of a civilized race; the
parent-speech to which we may inductively trace them
back was spoken by men who stood on a relatively high
level of culture, and was as fully developed, as inflectional,
in short, as Sanskrit or Latin themselves. Such a speech
can tell us far less of the early condition of language than
the Bushman dialects of our own day, and to make the
conclusions derived from the examination of it of universal
validity, or so many revelations of the primitive state of
speech, would be a serious error.</p>

<p>The exceptional character of the Aryan group of languages
has been made apparent by the application of the
method learnt from its investigation to other groups of
tongues. The four most important groups which have
yet been examined, are the Malay-Polynesian, as explored
by W. von Humboldt, Buschmann, Von der Gabelentz,
and Friedrich Müller; the Bâ-ntu of Southern Africa, the
scientific investigation of which is due to Bleek; the Athapasian
and Sonorian of North America, of which Buschmann
has been the Bopp; and, above all, the Ural-Altaic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
otherwise called the Ugro-Altaic, or Turanian, which is
now, owing to a variety of circumstances, receiving a
special attention. The work begun by Castrèn, Schott,
Böhtlingk, and Max Müller, has been continued by Boller,
Budenz, Donner, Hunfálvy, Ahlqvist, Thomsen, Ujfalvy,
Schiefner, and others; and so far, at all events, as the
Finnic group is concerned, “Turanian” philology is almost
as far advanced as Aryan philology itself. But the limits
of the Ural-Altaic family as a whole are still not quite
settled; while Dr. Edkins would connect Chinese with
Mongol roots, others question the affinity of Mongol
itself to the Tatar-Finnic languages, and Weske has even
gone so far as to class the Finnic dialects among the inflectional
tongues, and to hint at their connection with
the languages of the Aryan family. But this is to follow
in Bopp’s footsteps only when he endeavoured to trace
the dialects of Polynesia and Europe to a common
source.</p>

<p>The creation of a science of language has brought with
it the creation of a science of comparative mythology and
a science of comparative religion. Language is at once
the expression and the creator of thought, and the history
of language is consequently the history of human
thought. Now mythology is a record of the way in which
primitive man endeavoured to explain the phænomena of
nature and his relation to the world, just as religion—that
is, religion as crystallized in dogmas and systems—is a
record of man’s attempt to represent his feelings and
belief in relation to a higher power. The record can only
be interpreted by the science of language; it is only when
we come to understand the meaning of the language of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
mythology that we understand the meaning of mythology
itself. Just as it was Sanskrit which laid the foundation
of comparative philology, so, too, it was the hymns of the
Rig-Veda, the oldest monument of Sanskrit literature,
which laid the foundation of comparative mythology.
The familiar forms and names of Greek myth met the
scholar again in the Vedic poems; but their faces were no
longer concealed by the veil of forgetfulness. The poets
of the Rig-Veda were still conscious of the true nature
and origin of Zeus (<i>Dyaus</i>) the “bright” sky, or Erinnys
(<i>Saraṇyu</i>) “the dawn,” and the old stories of the sun-god
and the powers of day are lighted up with renewed life
and significancy when we track them back to their ancient
home in the East. Not less important for the comparative
study of religion have been the inquiries into the
development of Brahmanism and its struggles with the
teaching of Buddha, necessitated by the examination of
the classical language and literature of India—inquiries
which could be carried on in the dispassionate spirit of
the scholar and without reference to the religious convictions
of the Western world. The settlement of the
exact meaning of a single word like <i>nirvâna</i> opens a fresh
chapter in the comparative history of religion. It is not
the least of Professor Max Müller’s services that he has
made both these new sciences household words and invested
them with a charm which has secured to them the
attention they deserve.</p>

<p>In England the scientific study of language has taken
a special direction in accordance with the practical character
of the nation. Men like A. J. Ellis, Bell, and Sweet,
have followed up the path first indicated by Grimm and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Lepsius, and devoted themselves to an exhaustive investigation
and analysis of articulate sounds. Aided by
Helmholz in Germany, and Prince Lucien Bonaparte in
London, they have determined the physical laws of utterance,
have classified the most minute varieties of sounds,
and pointed out the supreme importance, for phonological
purposes, of living dialects. Etymology has to a great
extent become a purely physical science: the connection
and derivation of words must be traced out in obedience
to the physiological laws of speech, and were it not that
a sound or group of sounds cannot become a word until
a meaning has been put into it, etymology might be described
as merely a branch of physiology. But phonology,
the science of sounds, is not synonymous with the science
of language; it is but a department, a subdivision, of the
master science, and deals only with the external, the
mechanical, the physical side of speech. The relations of
grammar and the inner signification of words and sentences
are what constitute the real essence of language,
and in so far as these belong to thought and not to the
mere vocal organs of the body, the science of language,
like the other sciences which have to do with the mind,
must be described as a historical and not as a physical
science. There has been a tendency among some philologists
to push phonology beyond its proper sphere and
make it co-extensive with comparative philology: it is
this inclination which has lain at the root of the attempt
to include the science of language among the physical
sciences; but phonology is concerned only with the outward
framework of speech, not with its inward essence.
This framework, however, it is, by means of which we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
able to investigate language, and the very fact of its
being subject to physical laws which admit of no contravention,
gives the modern science of language its
scientific certainty, and constitutes the difference between
it and the old punning etymology in which, as Voltaire
said, the consonants counted for nothing and the vowels
for very little. Before a single derivation can be admitted
it must be shown to be in accordance with the ascertained
phonological laws of the languages we are studying;
before it can be justified it must satisfy the requirements
of sense and history. The outward form is the key to
the inward fact which it embodies; we can get at the
original force and meaning of grammatical relations and
derivative words only by interrogating the phonetic
utterances by which they are expressed. The science of
phonology is the entrance to the science of language, but
we must not forget that it is but the outer vestibule, not
the inner shrine itself.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to state thus in detail the distinction
between phonology and the science of language
as a whole, because a good many of the theories that
have been propounded in the name of the science
rest upon an unconscious confusion of the two. The
outward and the inward have not always been kept
apart, and nothing has been commoner than to argue
that a change in the pronunciation of a word or suffix
has been the <i>cause</i> of a change in its meaning. It has
even been thought that the phænomena of inflection
might all be accounted for by the action of phonetic
decay in stripping off the final parts of compound words,
and so disguising their primitive form (but not sense),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
and that when the comparative philologist has traced a
word back to its source in accordance with phonological
laws he has done all that is required of him. Even Plato
and Aristotle had a higher conception of the study of
language than this. No doubt the fact that a scientific
treatment of language rests primarily upon phonology
has had much to do with this one-sided view of speech,
but the resemblance of the method of comparative philology
to the method employed by the physical sciences
has also been a cause of it. Comparative philology has
been regarded as a physical science, language held to be
a concrete organism, independent of human volition
and with a growth analogous to that of the plant or
the animal, and the laws of language explained without
reference to the facts of psychology. The two Schlegels
are the first who may be accounted responsible for this
mode of dealing with language. Friedrich Schlegel
divided languages into the flectionless, the agglutinative,
and the inflectional, and treated the roots of languages
as so many seeds, which grew up and developed like the
acorn into the oak. A. W. Schlegel<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> calls the flectional
languages “organic, because they contain a living principle
of growth and development, and alone have, if I
may so express myself, an abundant and luxurious
vegetation.” In fact, speech was regarded by them as
something that exists separately and independently, and
the flections of the verb and noun believed to have
sprouted out of the root like so many leaves and
branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Schlegel’s mysticism, as Steinthal terms it, was exposed
by Bopp, who threw the languages of the world
into three groups: (1) those which, like the Chinese,
are “without a grammar;” (2) those which, like the
agglutinative and Aryan tongues, start with monosyllabic
roots, and, by the help of composition, end with a
grammar; and (3), lastly, the Semitic group, which expresses
the relations of grammar by internal change.
Bopp here commits at least three errors: (1) Chinese
is as fully organized, as much possesses a grammar, as
English or Latin; (2) the roots neither of the Aryan
nor of the agglutinative languages can be proved to be
monosyllabic, while the Aryan languages, at all events,
sometimes use internal vowel-change to denote grammatical
differences; and (3) to imply that the relations
of grammar have been called into existence in the Aryan
family by the passage of composition (or agglutination)
into flection is to ascribe the origin of the relations conceived
to exist between the several parts of our thought
to the outward accidents of phonetic decay. Bopp naturally
looked upon the laws of Aryan philology as
holding good for all other branches of human speech;
for him the parent Aryan language was the primitive
language of mankind, and the verbal and pronominal
roots discovered by the Sanskrit grammarians were assumed
to have constituted a language, and, in fact, to
have been the original language of the human race.
Agglutination was but an earlier stage of inflection, and,
in fact, was merely the form in which the unorganized
primitive speech came to possess a grammar by compounding
its roots together. No wonder, therefore, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
roots were confounded with words; that Chinese should
be described as consisting of “bare roots;” and that the
possibility should be admitted of deriving all languages
from a single source. Hence the endeavour to find a
place for the Polynesian and Caucasian dialects in the
Aryan family, and the stress laid upon the external
rather than the internal side of speech. Structure, morphology,
comparative syntax—these are ideas which
have been left to Bopp’s successors to work out. With
him language is still an organism, flowing from one
source and passing through a series of necessary changes;
it is, therefore, not so much a social product as a subject
of physical inquiry. This view of language was assailed
by Pott. He justly urges that we can only speak of
language as an organism metaphorically, and that there
is no inner necessity in language to develop like the
seed into the tree, or the chrysalis into the butterfly, than
there is in thought itself. The roots of language
have no existence apart from the mind; before they can
become words they must be clothed, now with this
form, now with that, according to their relation with
other words. Language, in fact, is the expression of
thought; it cannot be examined except in connection
with thought and the history of the human mind. The
science of language, accordingly, is one of the historical
or social sciences, and phonology is but the key whereby
we read the enigmas of the thought within. Languages
will differ according to the different ways in which men
have conceived the world and their relation to it. Pott,
therefore, is an advocate of the original diversity of languages,
and, as might be expected, endeavours to found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
a science of sematology, or of the signification of words,
by the side of the science of phonology.</p>

<p>Pott had been preceded in his general conception of
speech by Wilhelm von Humboldt; indeed, his advance
upon Bopp was due in some measure to Humboldt’s
previous labours. For Pott, it must be remembered, was
pre-eminently a phonologist, and to him we owe the extension
of the results obtained by Grimm in the Teutonic
languages to the whole body of Indo-European tongues.
Humboldt, like all other great masters, rather suggested
than worked out; and recent researches have shown that
the facts to which he attached his philosophical system,
such as the nature of the Kawi language of Java, are not
always to be trusted. He laid down that each single
language is the individual expression of the character of
a nation, though language, taken generally, “is an
organic whole,” from which the individual languages of
the world radiate as from a centre. The nearer each
language approaches the ideal of language, the more,
that is to say, it is free from peculiarities of thought and
expression, the less is it imperfect and, in the bad sense
of the term, individual. And since a language is the outward
expression of the mind and history of a nation, the
nation whose language is the most perfect has approached
the most nearly to a perfect culture and civilization. Language
is at once the most exquisite work of art and the
most marvellous creation of science that the spirit and intellect
of a people can produce, and its character, as tested
by the standard which linguistic science has to establish,
is a sure and certain clue to the stage of art and science
attained by its speakers. At the same time, Humboldt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
emphatically declares that language is not a product
(ἔργον), but an activity (ἐνέργεια); in other words, that language
and speaking are the same. But while maintaining
that language is the creative organ of thought, Humboldt
also maintained that it constitutes an independent
world of thought, thus confusing the two senses of the
word language—the one in which language is made
identical with the act of speaking, the other in which it
represents the whole body of significant sounds we
utter. Humboldt had been educated under the influences
of the Kantian philosophy, and in his theory of
language we may discover a reflection of Kant’s dualism
in the opposition he finds in speech between the general
and the individual, between language as an organic whole,
and individual languages which refuse to answer to the
ideal definition of speech.</p>

<p>Steinthal<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> has subjected Humboldt’s statements to a
very thorough-going criticism, and has exposed their
manifold inconsistencies as well as the dualism which
underlies them all. Humboldt’s philosophy of language
erred by following the <i>à priori</i> rather than the <i>à posteriori</i>
method; the facts discovered by comparative philology
were used by him as illustrations of his conclusions rather
than as the premisses upon which those conclusions were
built. Nevertheless, in spite of his <i>à priori</i> metaphysical
method—in spite of his laying down what language ought
to be instead of what it is, Humboldt’s genius scattered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
ideas and suggestions through his work which have proved
abundantly fruitful in the hands of later scholars. But
the value of these ideas was due to the far-sightedness
of his genius, not to his collection of facts, and he was
accordingly unable to harmonize and classify them, or
to erect upon them a sound theory of speech. Humboldt’s
great work consisted in teaching that language is
the expression of national thought, that it must be
treated as an organic whole; that, in short, its science
is a historical and not a physical one.</p>

<p>The work thus begun by Humboldt was taken up by
Heyse in his “System der Sprachwissenschaft.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Heyse
approached language from the point of view of the
Hegelian philosophy, but he strives to prevent the
<i>à priori</i> method from overriding the <i>à posteriori</i>. His
view of language professes to base itself on the results of
comparative philology, although the endeavour to force
them into an Hegelian mould is clearly traceable. It
really rests, however, upon an <i>à priori</i> conception of the
origin of speech, which is neither borne out by linguistic
facts nor easily realizable. Language, he holds, is spiritualized
sound: the world is a great vibratory organ,
in which all objects when touched emit a note, and so,
too, the human spirit, when affected by feeling or reason,
emitted certain sounds peculiar to itself, which we call
roots. Speech was as much a necessity to man as ringing
is to a piece of brass when struck. It is, in fact,
the music of the soul, and its development gauges the
spiritual development of its speakers. This development
of speech is, therefore, a wholly internal one, dependent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
not upon the outward phonology, but upon the
common spirit of man that has created it. The outward
sound is but the garment created by thought
wherein to clothe itself, but the garment is always suitable
to the thought it clothes. Since thought “must”
develop, language also “must” do the same, and language,
like thought, can develop only in a particular
way. This evolution necessarily depends upon the
existence of minds in which thought has become self-conscious,
reflective: “the speaking of children and
of the great mass of mankind is a lifelong, unconscious
activity—a mere natural activity of conscious
thought.” Such a theory of language is plainly mystical.
On the one hand, the natural sounds uttered by
a man under strong excitement do not constitute language,
but rather a barren list of interjections; on the
other hand, to speak of the soul, or mind, being affected
like ordinary objects of the sense, and accordingly emitting
sounds, is sheer mythology. Moreover, the evolution
of speech, of which Heyse speaks, is not a <i>necessary</i>
one: there is no necessity “in the very essence of
human speech” that the various forms of language—isolating,
agglutinative, inflectional—should have come
into existence. Language originated in the very prosaic
and unphilosophical need of intercommunication,
without which no community was possible, and so long
as this need could be supplied, the nature and perfecting
of the means was not even considered. The linguistic
garment of thought, it is true, generally (though by no
means always) fits the thought it clothes fairly well,
but only because the garment itself is to a great extent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
identical with the thought which it envelopes. To
deny that language properly so called exists for children
and uneducated persons, as Heyse finds himself
forced to do, is to deny that it was framed by primitive
man, which is, indeed, a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. Heyse’s
chief merit lies in emphasizing the fact that language is
not the work of the individual, but of the whole community,
and of a community, too, which consists of reasonable,
thinking beings.</p>

<p>Steinthal is the modern representative of the school of
W. von Humboldt. Language, he holds, is an activity,
an ἐνέργεια, everlastingly “becoming.” It has “broken
forth” necessarily from the human mind when the conditions
for its production were present, and in order,
therefore, to discover the origin and nature of language,
we must know the mental condition which preceded its
creation. It originated through the unconscious action
of psychological laws, without being willed into existence.
The same instinctive laws still operate when a
child is learning to speak: the learning is not a conscious
effort, and in the very act of learning speech is being
created anew. But these laws will only operate in a community,
the first condition for the “birth” of language
being that men should be united together in a common
society. Hence the need of a psychological ethnology
which should deal with the psychological phænomena,
not of the individual, but of the race. This alone will
enable us to penetrate to that “inner form of language”
which Humboldt failed to recognize, but which constitutes
language in a far more real sense than phonology
can ever do. This inner form of language is neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
more nor less than “apperception,” or a perception of
the relations between allied apprehensions, and is also
described by Lazarus as a “condensation of thought.”</p>

<p>Steinthal’s writings have proved as suggestive to other
scholars as those of Humboldt, but their effect is marred
by a want of clearness, as well as by an exaggerated use
of the <i>à priori</i> method. In opposing the tendency to
make phonology synonymous with the science of language,
Steinthal goes much too far on the opposite side.
Instead of using psychology to control the conclusions
of comparative philology, he deduces philological conclusions
from assumed psychological facts. Not psychology,
but comparative philology, can lead us to the first beginnings
of language, and raise the veil that covers its
origin. The error, however, which lies at the bottom of
Steinthal’s reasonings is, as in the case of Heyse, the
ambiguous use of the term language. Speaking, but not
language, may be described as an activity. So, too, the
faculty of speech may be said to be instinctive, which language
certainly cannot be. To assert that a child learns
to speak without conscious effort depends again upon an
ambiguous use of the word conscious: as a matter of
fact the child learns to speak in much the same way as
the adult learns a foreign language. Nor is it more than
a questionable metaphor to speak of language as “breaking
forth” or being “born.” Primitive man framed his
earliest speech with labour and difficulty; no doubt certain
mental and physical conditions were pre-supposed
by the process, but no amount of psychological, even
when conjoined with physiological, study will tell us
what these were: in order to discover them we must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
question the records of speech itself. Steinthal has been
misled, like his predecessors, by a false conception of the
roots of language: he has pictured them to himself as so
many mental germs thrown off spontaneously by the
mind, and forthwith forming a language; and since these
germs have a verbal signification in the Aryan family of
speech, he has further identified them with the concepts
of the mind. But roots are not words, and words are not
concepts.</p>

<p>Opposed to Steinthal is the school which groups the
science of language with the physical sciences, and of
which Schleicher, with his modern follower, Hovelacque,
may be considered the representative. It may be traced
back to Bopp and Grimm, the one with his microscopic
analysis of the suffixes and belief in the mechanical origin
of inflection out of a previous composition of independent
words, and the other with his engrossing regard for phonology
and adherence to Bopp’s theory of a primitive language
of roots. Jacob Grimm’s views may be best gathered
from his treatise “Ueber den Ursprung der Sprache” (1851).<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
In this he begins by comparing the science of language
with the investigation of natural history, the attempt to
discover the origin of speech being analogous to that of
discovering the laws of the production of animals or the
growth of plants. Like Goethe, Grimm inclines to believe
that mankind started from several separate pairs:
at all events, the distinction of gender in the noun implies
the influence of the female sex. Language has passed
through three different stages, the last being the analytic,
the middle the inflectional, and the earliest that of the determination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and composition of monosyllabic roots. It is
a purely human work, “emanating immediately from human
thought,” and, as such, the key to all human history.
The first words, which are identified with Aryan roots,
were invented by a sort of “wonderful instinct.” The
several vowels and consonants have each a particular
force and significancy, <i>l</i>, for instance, expressing softness,
<i>r</i> roughness, and in settling what vowel or consonant
should be taken to denote some special verbal idea,
the “inventor” of speech had for the most part to consult
his own “arbitrary choice.” Language, in short, is a
human invention, determined by the natural significance
of different articulate sounds; its growth means the
composition and decay of these various sounds. In order
to discover what it is, we have only to investigate the
history of this composition and decay—that is, the nature
and history of phonology. It is no wonder, therefore,
that Grimm started by comparing the comparative philologist
to the student of natural history, and imagined
that the phænomena of all human speech could be
learned from the examination of the Aryan family.
It is needless to point out the unverified assumption
which underlies the notion that each articulate sound
has a particular significancy, or the inconsistency of
this view with the admission of human volition in the
first invention of verbs. Grimm’s attempt to discover
the origin of language was a failure; it amounted to
stating that roots have a particular meaning because
that meaning is “natural” to them, and where this
tautological explanation seemed insufficient, to introducing
human caprice. But human caprice in the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
of the origin of language stands on the same footing
as the old theory of a social contract. It was all very
well for one primæval man to determine that a particular
sound should represent a particular verbal notion, but
how was he to communicate the fact to his neighbours?</p>

<p>Grimm, however, merely prepared the way for
Schleicher. In the three works in which he most clearly
sets forth his views on the nature and origin of language,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Schleicher affirms that language is a natural organism possessed
of a separate existence, and as little subject to the
will of the individual as the power of changing its song to
the will of the nightingale. The growth and decay of
language is in accordance with fixed immutable laws.
Its existence as an organism is due to its being the
audible manifestation or symptom of certain material
relations in the constitution of the brain and vocal organs,
and is consequently determined solely by those external
conditions of climate, food, inherited instincts, and the
like, which influence our nervous and muscular system.
History and the science of language have nothing to do
with one another. Like the phænomena of chemistry or
physiology, the phænomena of language must be regarded
as so many material facts which can only be the subject-matter
of a physical science. The science of language,
in short, is neither more nor less than phonology; the
signification of words is either incapable of scientific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
treatment, or else, like their pronunciation, a mere result
of determinable nervous action. The language we speak
is conditioned by our bodily organization and antecedents.
An European can only become a real master of
Chinese by ceasing to be an European and becoming,
mentally and physically, a Chinaman. Language, being
in no way subject to human volition, follows its own
necessary laws of growth and development. The inflectional
tongues have grown out of the agglutinative,
the agglutinative out of the isolating, and the isolating
are to be identified with that primæval language of roots
which is reached by analysis in the Aryan group. The
acquisition of this root-language created man; the primates,
who were less favoured by circumstances than
their brethren, and consequently did not develop speech,
fell back into the condition of anthropoid apes. Hence
the importance of the science of language for the Darwinian
theory. Not only do we see language developing
by slow degrees from the simple to the complex by the
aid of natural selection, but it is through language alone
that man is separated from the brute; so that before the
beginning of language—a beginning which linguistic
science can demonstrate with certainty—man was in no
way distinguishable from the other primates. Language
thus becomes the most important, it may be said the
sole, test of race and lineage. The Ethiopian can change
his skin sooner than his mother-tongue. The languages
of the world cannot be carried back to a single source.
There are at least as many original languages as existing
families of speech. The resemblances detected between
them are due to geographical position; the nearer they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
were to one another at the outset, the more the speakers
were subjected to the same external influences, the greater
will be their similarity. A time comes when the creation
of languages ceases, and is replaced by the entrance of a
race into history. It is before this period, therefore, that
the external influences, the geographical conditions, will
have to act.</p>

<p>Schleicher’s views, it will be seen, are based on the
false assumption that language is an actual entity existing
apart from the minds and the mouths of its speakers.
In the course of his argument he found himself forced
to adopt a position somewhat inconsistent with this
assumption. If language is a symptom of the brain
and vocal organs, it can hardly be described as an independent
organism. In so far as phonology is concerned,—that
part of language, namely, which depends on
the vocal organs,—the physiological laws which determine
it can be ascertained in the same way and with the same
certainty as the other laws of physiology; but mere
phonetic sounds do not become language until they embody
a signification; and though it may be quite true
that every act of thought is preceded by a change in the
molecules of the brain, yet this change is altogether unknown
to us, and our only way of discovering the laws
and principles of language is by questioning language
itself, not by investigating the alterations undergone by
the material of the brain. The morphologic facts of language
must be studied in the same way as the facts of
sociology, of psychology, or of any other science that has
to do with the mind. The science of language, taken as
a whole, cannot be counted among the physical sciences.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
To identify it with phonology is to identify the whole
with its part. Unless we treat language historically, its
study becomes little more than a dry enumeration of the
several languages of the globe and their distinctive peculiarities.
Not being an independent entity, it cannot follow
necessary laws of its own. The laws of its life and growth
are really the laws which govern the action of society in
a particular direction. To speak of the impossibility of
thoroughly mastering a foreign language is absurd. The
same difficulty a member of one community finds in
transforming himself into a member of another community
recurs in the case of language, but the fact that an
English child born in India will speak Hindustani as his
native tongue, is sufficient to show that the power of
speaking a special language does not depend on a special
organization and ancestry. Language is the creation of
society. An individual speaks a certain language because
he belongs to a certain society. As we shall see hereafter,
language is no test of race; only of social contact.
As for the primæval root-language, we have no proof that
it ever existed, and to confound it with a modern isolating
language is simply erroneous. Equally unproved is the
belief that isolating dialects develop into agglutinative,
and agglutinative into inflectional. At all events, the
continued existence of isolating tongues like the Chinese,
or of agglutinative tongues like the Magyár and Turkish,
shows that the development is not a <i>necessary</i> one. Not
less difficult to prove is the fancy that there are two
periods in the life of speech—one in which men are giving
themselves up to the production of language, the other
when they are creating history. There is merely an analogy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
between the action of natural selection in language
and natural selection in the organic world. The science
of language can tell us nothing of the descent of man.
Man, it is true, is man in virtue of language; but, on
the other hand, he must have been man to create language.</p>

<p>Bréal, the leading French philologist, gave at one
time a qualified approval to the essential part of
Schleicher’s theories, and their chief advocate at present
is another French scholar, Abel Hovelacque. He
has availed himself of Broca’s investigations, according to
which the organ of language must be placed in the left
(more rarely the right) cerebral hemisphere in the
posterior half of the third frontal convolution. Hovelacque’s
work on the science of language<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> exhibits the
defects of Schleicher’s theory of language, as it contains
little more than a catalogue of the various families of
speech with their distinguishing characteristics. The
physical theory of language allows for little more than
what may be called a natural history treatment of it;
the action of emphasis and analogy, of phonetic decay
and dialectic growth, and all the other questions involved
in a morphologic and historical treatment of speech are
necessarily ignored. Faidherbe, another French follower
of Schleicher, endeavours to bridge over the gulf between
man and the ape by pointing on the one side to the inarticulate
clicks of the Bushman, and on the other to the
six different sounds uttered by the <i>cebus azaræ</i> of Paraguay
when excited, which arouse corresponding emotions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
in other members of the same species.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Bleek<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> with
Häckel’s help had already traced the utterances of
speech to the cries of the anthropoid apes, and laid down
that articulate language is distinguished from inarticulate
by being broken up and mobilized. The germ of the
suggestion was given by Steinthal, who first pointed out
that language approaches its ideal the more analytic
it is; sounds, like ideas, become articulate when they
cease to be indefinite and indistinct. Bleek holds that
the imitation of instinctive sounds made by others to
express certain emotions first reminded the earliest men
of the same feelings in themselves which had prompted
them to the same kinds of utterance, and so led them to
compare and distinguish the feeling and its vocal sign,
the outward utterance and the inward signification.
Language is thus of interjectional origin, helped by the
imitative instinct, and language in the course of its development
created and moulded thought.</p>

<p>Like Bréal, Max Müller inclines to regard the science
of language as a physical rather than as a historical
one, and would compare it with geology so far as its
method is concerned. He, too, holds that language is
the creator of conceptual thought; without the word,
without the bond or memorandum which is to keep our
individual impressions together, a general idea, and consequently
reasoned thought, would have been impossible.
Apart from inherited instincts, the deaf-mute, like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
infant, has only the capability for thought so long as he
is unprovided with a language of some sort. No theory,
whether onomatopœic or interjectional or otherwise,
which has attempted to explain the origin of language
has succeeded in its task; for language is environed on
all sides by the barrier of roots, and in roots alone we
must seek its origin. How these roots may themselves
have originated we do not know; probably onomatopœia
and the reflex action of sounds excited by a
common action had much to do with it; but the science
of human speech is concerned only with the question of
the origin of language, not with that of the origin of
roots. The roots, however, once constituted a real language
which may be compared with the Chinese of to-day,
and which in certain instances passed through an
agglutinative into an inflectional stage of development.
The roots were, for the most part, not monosyllabic;
whether there was one common stock of roots at the
beginning, or an indefinite number of stocks, we have no
means of determining. What we know is that dialects
precede languages, that out of the many comes the one,
and that in the drifting desert of human speech, only
three or four families, like the Aryan, the Semitic, or the
Ugro-Altaic, have been able to establish themselves.
At the bottom of Max Müller’s theory of language seems
to lie the philosophic postulate that the universal precedes
the particular; the roots of language are so many
“phonetic types,” so many universals, out of which the
manifold forms and words of living speech have been
developed. They constitute the background of those
concepts whereon the structure of thought has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
reared. With the mythopœic epoch of speech all was
changed. Then the particular came to precede and
create the universal, and out of individual words which
had lost their original meaning were built up the myths
of Greece and Rome. In each case the process was an
unconscious one; the will of the single man can no more
change the tendencies and growth of language than it
can change the force of the winds. Max Müller thus
stands midway between Schleicher and Steinthal.</p>

<p>Side by side with the school of Schleicher there has
sprung from the doctrines of Bopp what may be termed
the common-sense school of philologists. As perhaps is
natural, it is mainly in practical America and England
that the school has found its adherents, among whom
Whitney may be considered its most prominent representative.
He states the theories (as opposed to the
method and philological facts) of Bopp in their clearest
and most extreme form, and does not shrink from carrying
them out to their logical conclusions. Thus it is affirmed
that the first men spoke in monosyllabic roots, which by
means of composition passed into an agglutinative form of
speech, and that again, in a similar way, into inflection. All
flection may be analyzed into a preceding agglutination,
and all agglutination into a preceding juxtaposition of
roots, the latter being both predicative and pronominal.
Whitney holds that language is an institution like government,
and that it is absolutely dependent on the human
will, determined only by the necessities of society. The
phonetic forms and meanings of words are assigned to
them by the conscious or unconscious action of a community.
Language is, in all strictness, a human invention,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
in which onomatopœia probably played a large
part. Its science consequently will be a historical one.
Thought is prior to language; language therefore did
not create thought, nor can it be treated as a separate
organism existing apart from its speakers. The origin
of language is explained very simply by the need of intercommunication
between those who first used it, and
since it is always the expression and sign of thought, we
may call them, with perfect accuracy, its inventors. Just
as thought which is universal precedes language, so a
single parent-speech precedes dialects.</p>

<p>Whitney’s views, however, require too many still unproved
assumptions to be received as ascertained truths;
the existence of a parent-speech, for instance, being as
hypothetical as the transition of one form of speech into
another. Too little regard also is paid to the physiological
side of language, that side which connects it with the physical
sciences; while too much influence is assigned to the
human will in its formation. It cannot with any real strictness
be termed an institution, because an institution has
often been founded or changed by an individual, and over
language the individual has no such power. Whitney
attributes too much design, too much volition, to the
formation of speech; the need of intercommunication
alone will not explain its origin, since we may ask, How
did this need arise, and how were the means of supplying
it communicated? However much language may
now be defined as the expression of thought, it was not
so at first, when conceptual thought was made possible
only by the help of language; and even now language is
rather the embodiment, however imperfect, than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
sign of thought. The stress, moreover, laid upon the
element of volition in the production of speech is inconsistent
with the idea that mere juxtaposition and
phonetic decay could have effected that change in the
way of viewing things and their relations which is involved
in the transition from one form of speech to the
other.</p>

<p>The problem of the origin of language was taken up
from a wholly different point of view by Lazarus Geiger.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
He traced it to the instinct of imitation so deeply implanted
in the nature of man. The expression of feeling, of
pain and pleasure, of anger and love was indicated partly
by corresponding cries, partly by the muscular movements
of the face, which might or might not accompany
them. The imitation of these movements on the part of
a second person caused a particular gesture and the cry
that accompanied it to be associated with the idea of
passion, pleasure, or pain that had given rise to it.
Gradually the gesture was merged in the cry, and the
cry was changed into a root or word. Each root was,
therefore, at the outset, an embodiment and symbol of
an action. Hence it is that the roots to which language
can be traced back are all verbal, all expressive of movement
and action. Since the publication of Geiger’s book,
the whole subject of the “Expression of the Emotions in
Men and Animals” has been elaborately worked out by
Mr. Darwin in a special work, while Benfey has independently
pointed out how large an influence the physical
accessories of speech must have originally had in putting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
sense and significancy into the sounds associated with
them.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Looks, gestures, and the modulation of the
voice are common to man and the lower animals, but
whereas the import of looks and the modulation of the
voice agrees all over the world, that of gestures does
so only in part. How, then, could gestures have the
same unambiguous meaning for others which Geiger’s
theory would demand? The answer is given by Ludwig
Noiré, who takes up and completes the theory of his
master. The weak point in the latter is that it makes
language, which is essentially a social product, the creation
of the individual. Noiré, in a volume at once singularly
lucid and suggestive,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> successfully meets the difficulty.
He recalls the rhythmical cries or sounds which a body of
men will make when engaged in a common work, and
which seem the product of a common impulse. We are
all familiar with the cries of sailors when hauling a rope
or pulling the oar; with the shout of the Eastern vintagers
as they beat time in the wine-press; or with the yell of
savages when they attack a foe. In such cries and shouts
as these Noiré would discover the beginnings of speech.
They seemed called forth by the work in which men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
were engaged for a common purpose, and so became to
them the expression and symbol of it. Once established
as intelligible symbols, they constituted those roots which
are at once the earliest form of language and the germs
out of which all future language has grown. Hence it
is that roots denote actions and not objects; hence, too,
the fact that the sense of sight must be regarded as the
first stepping-stone to speech. Like Geiger, Noiré is a
philosopher rather than a philologist, and his explanation
of Aryan roots and their connection with one another
frequently contravenes the laws of scientific etymology.
Nor can his identification of roots and words be admitted,
or the actual existence at any time of the hypothetical
roots of the Aryan tongues. But his theory doubtless
explains the origin of much that is in speech, though it
does not explain everything. Onomatopœia is not excluded
from sharing in the creation of language, nor can
we refuse to recognize the interjectional source of certain
roots and words. But even if it will not solve the whole
problem, Noiré’s theory clears up the origin of that part
of speech which has hitherto appeared hardest to explain.
Like the song of the birds, the language of man, too, is
instinctive and necessary, called forth by a sense of life
and energy, by a common participation in a common
work.</p>

<p>Outside the school of Bopp stands a group of scholars of
whom the best known are Scherer, Westphal, and Ludwig.
They agree in rejecting Bopp’s analysis of Aryan
grammar and his derivation of flection from a previous
agglutination. Grammatical analysis has doubtless been
pushed much too far both by Bopp and by his pupils,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and the protest raised against it, although needlessly indiscriminating,
has done considerable good. Westphal has
recourse to the old trappings of pre-scientific philology,
pleonastic letters, apocope, and so forth, and lays down
common “logical categories” of flection for both the
Aryan and the Semitic families.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> He defines language
as “the embodiment of the content of the human consciousness,”
and holds that its object is to reduce the individualism
of nature to a unity of conception. What is
given as separate and individual is unified by thought
and language, and the development of language is in accordance
with this process of unification. The process,
or “movement,” of consciousness finds its expression in
the corresponding movement of speech; just as thought
sums up the individual parts of any perception under a
single concept, so language sums up the individual parts
of phonetic utterance under the sentence. The result of
this movement is the evolution of the verb and the completion
of organized speech. Sound and concept are
brought together by the common element of “movement,”
a curious return to the κίνησις of Aristotle. It is
evident, however, that Westphal rather restates the phænomena
of language in metaphysical language than
really explains them, while his entire rejection of Bopp’s
method and results makes criticism difficult.</p>

<p>Ludwig, like Westphal, rejects the current theory of
flection, but substitutes for it another which can not only
be supported by facts, but is also not inconsistent with
the method founded by Bopp. Flection, he believes, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the result not of agglutination, but of adaptation, certain
unmeaning terminations of existing words being selected
to express new grammatical relations when they first
dawned upon the mind.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Ludwig’s view seems to have
met with partial acceptation among some of the younger
French philologists, and it is supported by Bergaigne’s
researches into the nature of the case-suffixes.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The
analysis of the latter has always been a stumbling-block
in the way of the current theory; Bergaigne has
made it clear that they were either the terminations
of abstract nouns or else suffixes which have been
adapted in different words to the expression of very
different meanings. On the other hand, Ludwig’s theory
fails when applied to the verb, and we still need an explanation
of the manner in which the same select number
of meaningless terminations came to be attached to
so large a variety of words. But the advocates of the
agglutination hypothesis have the same difficulty to
contend against when they deal with the stem-suffixes.</p>

<p>In pursuance of Bopp’s method, but independently of
the distinctive theories of his school, Waitz, the anthropologist,
has propounded a new theory of language.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> As
we do not think in words, but in sentences, and as
language is the expression and embodiment of thought,
it is clear that the unit of language must be the sentence
and not the word. The words which compose a sentence
are related to one another in the same way as the several
elements of an idea, or of an action as reproduced in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
thought, and can only be decomposed and separated by
conscious analysis. Consequently the incorporating
languages of America, in which an individual action is
represented by a single sentence pronounced as one word,
are a survival of the primitive condition of language
everywhere. It is only gradually that the different
parts of speech are distinguished in the sentence, and
words formed by breaking up its co-ordinated elements
into separate and independent wholes. Originally words
could as little be used alone and without relation as
our own suffixes <i>ly</i> or <i>ness</i>. The agglutinative tongues
in which the subordinate parts of a sentence are brought
into duly dependent relation to the principal concept are
more highly advanced than the inflectional, the “fundamental
idea of which is that the principal and the subordinate
elements of thought (<i>Vorstellung</i>) remain independent
and separate, and never coalesce into a single
word.” This principle of flection, however, can never
be logically carried out, since the relations of the central
idea expressed by the suffixes are themselves a
kind of subordinate conception; if <i>amatis</i> is right where
the personal pronoun is treated as a suffix, then <i>amator
bonus</i>, where the attribute <i>bonus</i> is regarded as a subordinate,
and therefore separate, conception, must be wrong.
An isolating language like the Chinese stands on the
highest level of development, since here the sentence
has been thoroughly analyzed and each member of
it rendered clear and distinct, their relations to one
another being determined by position alone. Chinese
therefore has given concrete expression in language to
the philosophic analysis of ideas. Waitz’s view would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
harmonize with the antiquity and civilization of Chinese
much better than the ordinary one, as well as with its
resemblance to English and other modern analytical
languages; and it is to be noticed that Steinthal, when
speaking of Chinese, describes it as a language in which
the real words are the sentences or groups of subordinated
vocables. Waitz’s theory of speech is the theory of an
anthropologist who, as the student of the master-science,
is better able to decide upon the origin of language than
the comparative philologist with whom the existence of
language has to be assumed. No science can of itself discover
the genesis of its subject-matter. Friedrich Müller
attaches himself to Waitz when he says:<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> “We disagree
with Schleicher and his school in this one point,
that the individual independent word is not the unity
for us that it is for him, but rather the sentence—the
shortest expression of thought.” As he goes on to
observe, only the context—that is, the whole sentence—can
determine whether <i>musas</i>, for example, is to be
taken as the accusative plural of a noun or, like <i>amas</i>,
the second person singular of a verb.</p>

<p>Philological opinion is therefore seen to be still divided
upon certain points. But such division of opinion is a
healthy sign of life and progress in the new science. It
is only by the conflict and discussion of theories that truth
can finally be reached, and the many controversies excited
by the science of language show how broadly and
deeply the foundations of the science are being laid. On
the phonological side the progress has been greatest and
most certain; morphology and the investigation of roots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
still lag behind; comparative syntax is but beginning to
be handled; and sematology, the science of meanings,
has hardly been touched. But the method inaugurated by
Bopp remains unshaken, the main conclusions he arrived
at hold their ground, and the existence of the Aryan
family of speech, with all its consequences, is one of the
facts permanently acquired for science. True, there are
many questions still to be settled. It is still disputed
whether the science of language is a historical or a
physical one; whether language is an independent
organism obeying fixed and necessary laws of its own
or an “institution” controllable by the will of man;
whether phonology is to exclude all other departments
of the science when the nature of the latter is discussed;
whether roots ever constituted a real language or are
merely the ultimate elements into which words may be
decomposed; whether the flectional stage of language
springs from the agglutinative, and this again from the
isolating; whether the languages of the world are the
selected residuum of infinite attempts at speech or have
flowed from one or two common sources; whether dialects
precede languages or languages dialects; whether
conceptual thought has created language or language
has created conceptual thought; whether, finally, the
word or the sentence is the true unit of speech. But
with all this diversity of opinion there is a yet greater
unanimity. There is no scientific philologist who doubts
the indispensable value of phonology and the absolute
strictness of its laws; who questions the axiom that roots
are the ultimate elements of articulate speech, the barrier
between man and brute, and that no etymology is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
worth anything which does not repose upon them; who
would compare the words of one family of speech with
the words of another in the easy-going fashion of a præ-scientific
age; or who would shut his eyes to the light
already shed on the history of the human mind and
the riddle of mythology by the study of the records of
speech. Language is the reflexion of the thoughts and
beliefs of communities from their earliest days; and by
tracing its changes and its fortunes, by discovering the
origin and history of words and their meanings, we can
read those thoughts and beliefs with greater certainty
and minuteness than had they been traced by the pen of
the historian, or even if</p>

<span class="smaller">THE NATURE AND SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE.</span></h2>

<p>“It is a law universally illustrated by organizations of every kind,
that, in proportion as there is to be efficiency, there must be specialization,
both of structure and function—specialization which, of
necessity, implies accompanying limitation.”—<span class="smcap">Herbert Spencer.</span></p>

</div>

<p>The review given in the preceding chapter of the opinions
held by others on language and its science or philosophy
will have prepared the way for an independent
inquiry into the nature and objects of linguistic science.
Before, however, we can discuss the limits and character
of the science we must have a clear idea of the subject-matter
with which it deals. Most of us, no doubt,
have a rough-and-ready definition to give of language;
but science requires something more than rough-and-ready
definitions, and the discordant views as to the
scope and meaning of the science of language which have
come before us in the foregoing pages are plain evidence
that an accurate definition of language is not so
easy as would at first sight appear.</p>

<p>Provisionally, however, we may define language as <i>consisting
of certain modulations of the voice, variously combined
and arranged, which serve as symbols for the thoughts
or feelings we wish to express</i>. The sounds that we utter
must have a <i>meaning</i> before they can become language,
otherwise they will be mere cries or gibberish, less worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
of the name of language than even the howling of the dog
upon the prairie or the wild song of the forest-bird.
Language is the outward expression and embodiment of
thought—the garment, so to speak, with which the mind
clothes itself when it would reveal itself to another or
even, it may be, to itself. The words of a foreign tongue
form a language only for those who understand what they
signify: for those who do not they are but empty sounds,
the idle murmur of a “barbarous” jargon. “The language
of birds” was discovered to the Eastern sage alone:
to all others the notes of the nightingale and the thrush
were as the plashing of the waterfall and the drowsy
humming of the bees. “Lessons in running brooks” may
indeed be read by the mind, but it is the mind itself that
puts them there, and only in so far as it creates a meaning
for them does it create also the language in which
they speak.</p>

<p>It is evident that our thoughts could be represented
by other symbols than sounds. The first and most familiar
instance that rises to our minds is writing, though
writing symbolizes thoughts only indirectly, its immediate
office being to symbolize sounds. There is a
written language because there is previously a spoken
language, and those who learn foreign tongues know well
how detrimental the power of reading a language is when
we wish to speak it: the language of the eye has to be
translated into the language of the ear. Language can
only be symbolized directly to the eye by hieroglyphics;
but if our communication with one another depended
upon hieroglyphic writing it would never be very extensive
or progressive. To say nothing of its requiring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
time, writing materials, and skill in drawing, hieroglyphic
writing can indicate objects alone with that clearness and
certainty which language demands. It is hardly possible
to represent in this way abstract ideas, verbs, or adjectives,
so that what is denoted shall be recognized by
another without previous instruction. Apart from these
drawbacks, however, picture-writing has this advantage
over spoken language, that its symbols are not mere
arbitrary signs like sounds, but intelligible all the world
over; and even the degenerated picture-writing of China,
by preserving everywhere the same character for the same
idea, has kept up a unity and spread a culture throughout
the empire which would otherwise have been impossible
among a people divided into many and diverse dialects.</p>

<p>Another means of symbolizing thought is “mathematical
language,” which represents the calculations of the
mathematician by written symbols such as 1, 2, 3, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>.
But such symbols are of late invention, and could not well
be applied to express the daily concerns of life. Quite
different is gesture-language, whereby our thoughts and
emotions are represented by movements of the hands and
other parts of the body. Most of our common needs
could be expressed in this way, though gestures would
be quite inadequate to represent the wants of a civilized
community. Only such ideas as “I am hungry,” “let me
drink,” “it is pleasant,” could be denoted by them. But,
like picture-writing, gestures possess the great advantage
of standing for the same ideas everywhere and among all
men. The expression of pain or surprise, the threatening
shake of the hand, the pointing of the finger, have the
same message for the Negro as for the European. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
traveller in a strange and unknown region is thrown back
upon the language of gesture. Burton,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> perhaps, exaggerates
when he says that the Arapahos of North America,
“who possess a scanty vocabulary, can hardly converse
with one another in the dark,” and another reason may
be given for this preference for the light; but the importance
of gesture-language where other means of communication
are wanting is too evident to need examples.
Thus Fisher<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> tells us that the Comanches and neighbouring
tribes have “a language of signs, by which all Indians
and traders can understand one another; and they always
make these signs when communicating among themselves.”
To the same effect James<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> writes of the Kiawa-Kashaia
Indians: “These nations, although constantly
associating together and united under the influence of
the Bear-Tooth, are yet totally ignorant of each other’s
language, insomuch that it was no uncommon occurrence
to see two individuals of different nations sitting upon the
ground, and conversing freely by means of the language
of signs. In the art of thus conveying their ideas they
were thorough adepts; and their manual display was
only interrupted at remote intervals by a smile, or by the
auxiliary of an articulated word of the language of the
Crow Indians, which to a very limited extent passes
current among them.” Gesture-language is instinctive—the
heritage, it may be, of the days before man acquired
articulate language, or differed thus far from the brute
beast: certain ideas call forth certain corresponding gestures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
and we are not obliged to learn what gestures stand
for particular ideas. Hence it is that even now spoken
language is so largely accompanied by gesture. An
excited speaker is likely to make much use of his hands;
and we can often tell what a person is saying to us, though
we do not hear him distinctly, by watching the play of
his features. We know from the appearance of his face
whether he is asking a question, whether he is angry, or
whether he is dispirited. With the cultivation of articulate
speech and confidence in the use of it, men become
more phlegmatic in speaking, less inclined to have recourse
to subsidiary helps. It is the awkward country girl whose
“manners” have “not that repose which stamps the caste
of Vere de Vere.” The preacher who addresses an
audience of barristers does well to dispense with the gesticulation
which is necessary to the mob-orator. According
to M. Antoine d’Abbadie, an Abyssinian Galla marks the
punctuation of his speech by the help of a leathern whip, a
slight stroke denoting a comma, a harder one a semi-colon,
a still harder one a full stop, while a note of admiration
is represented by a furious cut through the air.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Even in this country, we have not to go far to find
gesture-language employed in default of spoken language.
Where the new system of observing the movements of the
lips has not been introduced, the deaf and dumb can
communicate with the outer world only by the help of
gestures, though the gesture-language of the deaf and
dumb, like phonetic writing, implies a previous spoken
language. It is, therefore, to the instinctive gesture-language<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
of the North American Indians what our system of
writing is to hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that under the general term of “gesture-language”
we have included not only gesticulation,
but also that play of feature and modulation of the voice
which outlast gesticulation among a civilized people. Gesticulation
can hardly form a universal language in the same
way that play of feature and modulation of the voice
can. Only in part have such gestures the same meaning
for all men, and so serve to bridge over the gulf that
divides articulate from inarticulate speech. Like play of
feature and modulation of the voice, they are common to
men and animals; but, unlike the latter, they are capable
of receiving an arbitrary and conventional meaning. Helvétius,
following in the track of Anaxagoras, asserted that
we have become men through the possession of hands;
had our arms terminated in a horse’s hoof, for instance, we
should have been like the beasts that perish, wanderers
and defenceless.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Indeed, it is quite conceivable that our
forefathers would have remained contented with a gesture-language,
had not the hands been wanted for other
purposes. Food could not be prepared without them,
whereas it was not until the desire of food was satisfied
that the mouth was put to another use than that of asking
for it.</p>

<p>Still the arbitrary element in gesture-language is very
small compared with what it is in spoken language.
Here beyond a few interjections, or possibly a few onomatopœic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
sounds, the whole body of symbols that stand for
thought is purely conventional. The same combination
of sounds may be used to denote very different ideas.
There is no necessary connection between an idea and a
word that represents it. It is as arbitrary as our making the
sign 1 symbolize the idea of unity or the sign = the idea
of equivalence. However well we may be acquainted with
our own language, a foreign one will be wholly unintelligible
to us until we have learnt it. Even natural sounds
strike the ear of different individuals and nations in a
totally different way. Exactly the same sound was intended
to be reproduced in the “<i>bilbit</i> amphora” of
Nævius,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the “<i>glut glut</i> murmurat unda sonans” of the
Latin Anthology<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and the <i>puls</i> of Varro; nay, as Dr. Farrar
points out, even in the κόγξ and the βλώψ of the Greeks.
The Persian <i>bulbul</i> has but little resemblance to the <i>jugjug</i>
of Gascoigne, or the <i>whitwhit</i> of other writers; and yet all
are attempts at imitating the note of the nightingale.
The first word uttered by the children on whom Psammitikhus
is said to have tried his famous experiment
seemed to their keepers to be βέκ[ος], whereas we read in
the great Papyrus Ebers, the standard work on Egyptian
medicine compiled in the sixteenth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, that if
“a child on the day of birth ... says <i>ni</i>, it will live; if
it says <i>ba</i>, it will die.” And only the last of these infantile
cries bears any likeness to what we are told are the
primitive and original utterances of childhood, <i>ma</i>, <i>pa</i>, and
<i>ta</i>—utterances, by the way, which are only in part possible
to the Mohawks and Hurons, who possess no labials.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
arbitrary and conventional must be the meanings we
associate with the sounds of articulate speech, and so impossible
is it to discover in them any signs of universal
currency. There is no reason in the nature of things why
the word <i>book</i> should represent what we mean when we
look at the present volume; it might just as well be
denoted by <i>koob</i>, or <i>biblion</i>, or <i>liber</i>; and if we chose we
might always so denote it.</p>

<p>But although we might choose to do so, unless we
could get other people to do the same, we should find
ourselves unintelligible to our neighbours, and talking
gibberish instead of a language. For the essential thing
about a language is that it should be <i>an instrument for
the communication of our thoughts to others</i>. There is no
good in having symbols for our thoughts unless we wish
our thoughts to become known to those about us. He
who has no thoughts to communicate, no wants to be
supplied, has no need of a language. But such a being,
to use the words of Aristotle, is ἢ θηρίον ἢ θεός, “either a
beast or a god;” or as we might, perhaps, render it in
modern phraseology, either a hermit or an angel. The
voiceless Yogi of India, or the Bernardine nun of southern
France, is but as a dumb animal, or the hapless deaf-mute
who has never been trained. The records of speech
themselves testify to our instinctive recognition of the
fact. The name <i>Slave</i>, for instance, by which so large a
body of our Aryan kinsfolk have called themselves,
means “the speaker,” in opposition to the “dumb” and
unintelligible German; just as in Isaiah (xxxiii. 19), the
Assyrians are a people “of a stammering tongue, that
one cannot understand.” <i>Man</i>, indeed, comes from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
root <i>man</i>, “to think;” but it is thinking for others, for
the sake of embodying the thought in spoken utterance.
The same root has produced μάντις, the “seer;” Μέντωρ and
<i>Minerva</i>, whose counsels are for others, not for themselves;
μηνύω, to “point out,” and <i>moneo</i>, to “advise;”
μνή-μη, “recollection,” and <i>memini</i>, to “remember,” and
<i>mentio</i>, “the bringing to mind” by mentioning in speech.
Even in the Semitic idioms, <i>zâcâr</i>, “a man,” seems connected
with <i>zâcâr</i>, “to remember,” just as the Latin <i>mas</i>
is with μνήμη and <i>memini</i>. Language, in short, is the prerogative
of man, distinguishing him from the brute beast,
because it is the basis and bond of society. Man is “a
social animal” in virtue of language; society could not
exist without language any more than language could
without society. The two are correlative terms, though
it is for the sake of society that language has been
formed. It is a social product, springing up with the
first community, developing with the increasing needs of
culture and civilization, and disappearing when the individual
Robinson Crusoe is cast back on the island of
primitive isolation.</p>

<p>But though it is a social product, it may also with strict
truth be spoken of as growing up. A society never met
together to <i>make</i> a language. To imagine this would be
to revive the theories of the last century, which referred
all society and government to a contract entered into by
our remote forefathers. We do not call the present
volume a <i>book</i> because we have made a formal agreement
with our neighbours to do so, but because if we
called it <i>biblion</i> or <i>liber</i> we should not be understood by
the majority of them. The language which we speak is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the heritage which has come down to us from the past,
like the laws by which we are governed, or the habits and
customs to which we conform. We represent our idea of
a printed work by the word book, because we have been
taught to do so by others, and those who taught us had
been taught by others, and those again by others. But
this process of teaching and learning implies a very slow
and gradual change in the language that is being handed
down. New words come into use as new objects and
ideas have to be named, old words are forgotten, the pronunciation
gets altered, and other changes hereafter to be
described take place. And so, without any deliberate intention
on the part of any individual or individuals, the
whole character of a language comes in course of time to be
transformed. Now and then, it is true, we can trace the invention
of a wholly new word to an individual, like <i>gas</i> to
the Dutch chemist van Helmont, or <i>od</i> force to Baron von
Reichenbach; and still oftener of a new derivative like
<i>liberalize</i>, introduced by the Marquis of Lansdowne,
<i>fatherland</i> by Isaac Disraeli, <i>incuriosité</i> by Montaigne,
<i>urbanité</i> by Balzac, or <i>bienfaisance</i> by the Abbé de Saint
Pierre. But such words must be accepted by society, be
ratified by the tacit agreement of the whole community,
before they can become a part of living speech. Though
<i>gas</i> has made its way into common use, <i>blas</i>, which van
Helmont proposed at the same time to describe that property
of the heavenly bodies whereby they regulate the
changes of time, failed to commend itself to the general
sense of the community, and so passed out of sight;<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and
such was also the fate of Balzac’s <i>sériosité</i>, of Malherbe’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
<i>dévouloir</i>, and of Burke’s <i>literator</i>. In spite of his 262
works, and the grammars and vocabularies written to explain
the jargon employed in them, Caramuel, a famous
Spanish bishop of the seventeenth century, was unable to
bequeath to posterity a single one of his numerous coinages.
The “Cabalistic Grammar,” published at Brussels
in 1642, and the “Audacious Grammar,” printed at
Frankfurt twelve years later, remained unread and unknown,
a monument of “cabalistic” dreams and “audacious”
folly.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> A paternal government may compel the
acceptance of a foreign speech, in place of the familiar
mother-tongue, like the rulers of Japan, who were said, a
short time ago, to be meditating the substitution of English
for the native language under pain of death. But even a
government of this kind cannot invent a new grammar
and a new dictionary; it can only borrow from others:
and if we are to judge from the experiences of certain
Oxford colleges where French was similarly enforced in
the days of the Plantagenets, and Latin in those of the
Commonwealth, the attempt, though backed by all the
powers of State and Church, is likely to end in failure.
Language must be the unconscious creation of the whole
society, and the changes it undergoes must be equally
that society’s unconscious work.</p>

<p>Now the sum of knowledge possessed by a society increases
the longer the society exists and the more civilized
it becomes. This increase of knowledge is reflected in the
language; and hence languages grow fuller and richer—more
developed, as it is termed—the longer they last.
The further back we can trace a language, the poorer it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
is seen to be. Not only are words, or rather derivatives
and compounds, wanting, but the words that exist embody
but a few out of the many meanings which afterwards
cluster around them. The dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon,
of the Ormulum, or even of Chaucer, is scant and
meagre compared with that at the disposal of a modern
English writer. The dialects of savages, which most resemble
what all languages originally were, have few
words, because they have few ideas to express, and such
ideas as are expressed are wonderfully simple. Thus, the
Tasmanians, when they wanted to denote what we mean
by “tall” and “round,” had to say “long legs” and
“like a ball” or the “moon” or some other round object,
eking out their scanty vocabulary by the help of gesture.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
So, too, the New Caledonians cannot be brought to
understand such ideas as those conveyed by <i>yesterday</i>
and <i>to-morrow</i>, and the jungle Veddahs of Ceylon are
unable to remember even the names they give to their
wives, unless the latter be present.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> After this, it is not
surprising that, like the Dammaras of South Africa, they
are unable to count, and, consequently, have no numerals
in their language. According to Mr. Galton,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> indeed, the
Dammaras are able to count as far as three, though he
adds that they discover the loss of an ox, “not by the
number of the herd being diminished, but by the absence
of a face that they know.” If two sticks of tobacco are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
“the rate of exchange for one sheep, it would sorely
puzzle a Dammara to take two sheep and give him four
sticks.” “Once,” he goes on to say, “while I watched a
Dammara floundering hopelessly in a calculation on one
side of me, I observed Dinah, my spaniel, equally embarrassed
on the other. She was overlooking half-a-dozen
of her new-born puppies, which had been removed two or
three times from her; and her anxiety was excessive, as
she tried to find out if they were all present, or if any
were still missing. She kept puzzling and running her
eyes over them, backwards and forwards, but could not
satisfy herself. She evidently had a vague notion of
counting, but the figure was too large for her brain.
Taking the two as they stood, dog and Dammara, the
comparison reflected no great honour on the man.”</p>

<p>The number of abstracts possessed by a language is a
good gauge of its development. It is difficult for us to
realize the mental struggles and the ages of previous preparation
required for the discovery of those ideas which
now seem to us so familiar. The day on which, according
to the ancient legend, Pythagoras struck out the idea of the
<i>world</i>, and named it κόσμος, summed up all the labours of
Eastern philosophy and Greek thought before which the
law and order of the universe at last lay revealed. It is
to Anaxagoras, to Herakleitus, to Xenophanes that we
owe those ideas of mind, of motion, of existence which
form the groundwork of modern science. Nay, our own
generation has witnessed the creation of more than one
great abstract idea, henceforth to be the common property
of mankind, through the word by which it is expressed.
To have won for the race a single idea like that of <i>natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
selection</i> is a higher glory than the conquests of a Cæsar.
Man’s first work, according to the old Hebrew writer,
was to give names to “every living creature;” and the
Assyrian story of the Creation, with the profound conviction
that chaos is there where language is not, begins its
record with the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“At that time the heaven on high was unnamed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the earth below no name had been recorded:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And chaos unopened was their sire.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The words by which we express such abstract and
spiritual ideas as those of <i>spirit</i>, of <i>virtue</i>, or of <i>intellect</i>
are all, when examined, found to have a purely sensuous
origin. The <i>spirit</i> was but “the breath,” <i>virtue</i> “the
quality of a man,” <i>intellect</i> “a choosing between.” We
can only rise from the known to the unknown, from that
which we perceive to that which is invisible. As the
developing mind starts from the objects of sense, and
passes over the bridge of analogy to objects of thought
and reason, so, too, language, at the outset, had words
only for the visible and the sensuous; and not until it
called in the aid of metaphor could it express the higher
imaginations of the soul. If we look closely into language,
we may see how strewn it is with worn-out and
forgotten metaphors. “They are,” as Carlyle has said,
“its muscles and tissues and living integuments,” the
aids whereby language can communicate something
more than the things which we see and feel. Even
among ourselves, there are few who can afford to dispense
with the assistance of concrete illustration and
metaphor when dealing with abstract subjects. They
throw a halo of light around the impalpable objects of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
philosophic reasoning, and enable us to picture them
before our minds. It is this picture-language, as we may
call it, which gives so much of its charm to poetry, which
made verse the first embodiment of literature, and lends
to savage speech its poetical garb. The creations of
mythology are in the main its work; and even modern
science does not despise a “nature” which clothes itself
with the attributes of humanity and of sex. It was the
power possessed by language of rising from the concrete
to the abstract that made the earliest hieroglyphic systems
of writing possible, and which to this day enables
the Chinaman to adapt his mode of writing to the introduction
of new ideas. Like the Chinese lexicon, the
multitudinous wealth of language can be traced back to
a few and simple elements.</p>

<p>If we watch the first attempts of children to speak, we
find that their wants and wishes are conveyed in a very
small number of sounds, and that often a single word is
made to express what we should represent by several.
Now children, in spite of their inherited instinct of speech,
are the best example we can have of the way in which the
first men acquired their language, remembering only that
the child nowadays has a complete language already
framed for him, whereas the first men had to frame theirs
for themselves. What the individual child now learns
in a few years has been the laborious production of
many a century and many a generation. But the child
has still to learn it like his forefathers before him, and
in learning it he may modify its sounds, its forms, or the
meaning of its words, and so take part in bringing about
what we call the growth of speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>But it is not only by watching children that we can
gain some idea of the way in which languages originally
grew up. When we try to acquire a foreign tongue, not
from books, but from conversation, we first pick up a few
sentences and words, and then, by the help of these,
endeavour to make our thoughts and wishes intelligible
to others. But since the sentences and words we know
are but few, we have to look about us for the simplest
mode of expressing ourselves, and are obliged to make
our expressions stand for many different ideas. Even
then, however, our vocabulary is imperfect, and we often
find ourselves wholly at a loss for any word by which
to convey our meaning. Gestures are the only resource
left to us, and it is by their help that we supplement
our deficient knowledge of the spoken language. Indeed,
the first words and sentences learnt at all may have
been acquired by the same means. Travellers have
drawn up vocabularies and phrase-books of the idioms
of unknown tribes by pointing to objects or making use
of gesticulations, and then observing what articulate
sounds were associated with these movements by the
persons addressed. It is a good example of the way in
which gestures precede spoken language, and lead on to
the latter. The same gestures are for the most part
understood in the same sense among all the manifold
races of men; a shake of the head signifies “no,” a pointing
of the finger symbolizes “locality.” Gestures bridge
over the gulf which separates inarticulate from articulate
speech, and they are still a means of communication
for the deaf-mute. But we must distinguish between
gestures and that instinctive play of feature which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Darwin has treated of in his work on the “Expression
of the Emotions.” Gestures, in the proper sense of the
term, are only partly the same for all races of men; no
doubt the instinctive element preponderates in them, but
we have to allow also for a certain element of conventionality.
There is not the same physiological reason
why a shake of the head should denote a negative as
there is why a particular expression of the face should
indicate pleasure, or pain, or surprise, or why a feeling of
shame should bring a blush to the cheek. When we are
told that the Veddahs of Ceylon are never seen to laugh,
we at once infer that they have no sense of humour and
no power of merriment. Gestures are rather a sign for
the intellect than for the emotion, and since the same
feeling must express itself similarly in the case of every
one while the same thought need not, it is evident that
that which expresses thought admits the element of conventionality
more than that which expresses feeling.
Pain must always be pain, and affect the nerves and
muscles in the same way; what is thought of, on the
contrary, may be conceived very differently, and represented
in an equally varying manner. Hence it is that
we share the play of feature with the brutes, whereas
gestures—embodying as they do a rational rather than
an emotional element—are for the most part peculiar to
man. Man is man in virtue of language, and it was
gestures that first made language possible.</p>

<p>But gestures alone are often but a poor resource for
either the child or the traveller. They fail to express
the meaning intended. Let us suppose a child, for
example, to have been scratched by a cat, or frightened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
by a herd of cows. It can represent the pain it has
suffered, or the terror it has experienced by gestures,
but if it be unacquainted with the names of cat and
cow, it can only point out those animals by imitating the
sounds they utter; and <i>miow</i> and <i>moo-moo</i> become the
nursery names for “cat” and “cow.” And what still
goes on in the nursery was a general procedure in the
childhood of mankind. The domestic cat was introduced
into Egypt from Nubia in the time of the eleventh
or twelfth dynasty, and the Egyptians forthwith called
it the <i>miau</i>, a name which it still bears in China. Indeed,
the French and German equivalents of “puss,” <i>mimi</i>
and <i>mitz</i>, have the same origin as the <i>miow</i> of the nursery
or of Egypt, though German could not refrain from borrowing
the unmelodious ending of <i>katz</i>. Dr. Comrie
states<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that the natives of the north-east coast of Papua
call the dog a “bow-wow,” and when first shown an iron
axe named it <i>din-din</i>, from the sound which it seemed
to make.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> This imitation of natural sounds goes by the
long and barbarous name of <i>Onomatopœia</i>, and though
an attempt has been made to substitute “Imson” (<i>imitatio
son-i</i>) for “onomatopœic word,” it has failed.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Now
if we are to infer anything from the habits of the nursery,
and of those savage tribes which best represent the infancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
of mankind, onomatopœia must have played a large part
in the formation of language. Its advocates have done
much harm to what Professor Max Müller has happily
termed “The Bow-wow Theory,” by endeavouring to
trace back words as we now find them to an onomatopœic
origin; but this does not prove that the theory when
scientifically applied is false. It is true that there are
few words like <i>miow</i> which can be immediately referred
to an onomatopœic source; it is true also that articulate
language begins with roots, from which its scientific
student must derive its words; but it is equally true that
a large proportion of these roots—or rather of what these
roots presuppose—was formed by the help of onomatopœia.
It is not only objects like a dog or an iron axe
that the Papuans met by Dr. Comrie named from the
sounds they made upon his ear; an action like that of
“eating” was equally called <i>nam-nam</i> from the noise
produced by the process. We who speak a highly developed
language, the worn-out <i>débris</i> of which are more
than sufficient for the creation of new words and forms,
can hardly realize the influence of onomatopœia upon
rude and uncivilized jargons. Of course it is not necessary
that the imitation of natural sounds should be an
exact one; indeed, that it never can be: all that is
wanted is that the imitation should be recognizable by
those addressed. The same natural sound, consequently,
may strike the ear of different persons very differently,
and so be represented in articulate speech in a strangely
varying manner. Thus, as has been noted before, <i>bilbit</i>,
<i>glut-glut</i>, and <i>puls</i>, are all attempts to represent the same
sound. Just as colours strike differently upon the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of different men, so also do sounds upon their ears, and
the poverty of primitive languages in terms to denote
the colours is parallel to the imperfection with which
they represented natural sounds.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Besides gestures and onomatopœia, there is a third
way in which we can make ourselves intelligible without
knowing the articulate language of those to whom we
are speaking. This is by making use of interjectional
cries. Like the play of feature, interjectional cries
are the same for all men; we all make much the
same kind of exclamation when hurt, or angry, or
surprised. They express our emotions, not our ideas;
and since the main object of language is to express
ideas, interjectional cries can have had but a small share
in its formation. Here and there we can point to a few
roots, like <i>agh</i> (<i>ach</i>) in Aryan, which seem to have this
derivation; but before the root <i>agh</i> could become a root
in the linguistic sense of the word, and give rise to a
number of derivatives, it was needful for it to cease to
be an interjection; that is to say, it had to express an
idea, and not an emotion. Many of our modern interjections,
like <i>alas</i>, <i>lo</i>, are words that once possessed a full
conceptual meaning, but have lost their original signification,
and been degraded to the level of mere emotional
cries. So hard is it for language to admit
anything which was not from the first significant in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
thought. Interjections remind us of the animal side of
our nature, and they have forced their way into language
only because that animal side must be represented to
the mind. But in thus forcing their way they have
ceased to be the simple utterances of pleasure and pain,
and become expressive of conceivable states of feeling.
Only in so far as the first men approached the brutes
more nearly than we do, were interjectional cries likely
to help them in building up the structure of speech.
We may, however, include under the head of interjections
those instinctive cries uttered by men when
engaged in a common work, to which Professor Noiré
would trace all roots whatsoever.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The sense of life and
power that makes the child shout or the bird sing, and
is the ultimate motive of human speech, causes us to
beat time by the help of rhythmical utterances. And
though the utterance be but a monotonous sing-song, it
becomes a symbol and sign of the action it accompanies
to all those who have taken part in it, and in course of
time may pass into a word. How many of the roots of
languages were formed in this way it is impossible to
say, but when we consider that there is no modern word
which we can derive from such cries as the sailor
makes when he hauls a rope, or the groom when he
cleans a horse, it does not seem likely that they can
have been very numerous. Still they were probably
more numerous than the roots formed from other interjectional
cries.</p>

<p>The origin of language, then, is to be sought in <i>gestures</i>,
<i>onomatopœia</i>, and to a limited extent <i>interjectional cries</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Like the rope-bridges of the Himalayas or the Andes, they
formed the first rude means of communication between
man and man. Onomatopœic words and interjections
came to be metaphorically applied to denote other ideas
than those for which they properly stood, while the
relations of grammar were pointed out by the help of
gesticulation. Thus, by imitating the gurgling of water
and pointing to the mouth, a man could signify what we
express by the sentence, “I wish to drink,” or, “I am
thirsty;” and by uttering a cry of pain and pointing to
a knife, he could show that he had been cut by it. In
course of time a collection of words would be formed,
each of which represented what we now call a sentence.
For a sentence, it must be remembered, is the name
given by the grammarian to what the logician would call
a proposition or a judgment, and though a judgment
may be analyzed into subject and object and connecting
copula (or mental act of comparison), we cannot, if
we wish to be intelligible, separate its elements one
from the other. The whole sentence, the whole Λόγος, as
the Greeks would have termed it, is the only possible
unit of thought; subject and object are as much correlated
as the positive and negative poles of the magnet.</p>

<p>Language, then, we may lay down, begins with sentences,
not with single words. The latter exist only for
the lexicographer, and even the lexicographer has to
turn them into sentences by affixing a definition if he
would render them intelligible. We are accustomed to
see sentences divided into their individual words in
writing, and so we come to fancy that this is right and
natural. But the very accent which we lay upon our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
words ought to show us how far this is from the truth.
The accent of a word varies according to its place in a
sentence; for purposes of accentuation, we regard not
the individual words, but the whole sentence which they
compose. And this outward fact of accentuation is but
an indication of the inward fact of signification. All
language must be significant; but until the whole sentence
is uttered, until the whole thought which lies behind
it is expressed, this cannot be the case. The expression
of the thought may be faulty and imperfect, but
unless the thought be sufficiently expressed to be intelligible
to another, it has not yet embodied itself in the
form of language. The Greek Λόγος was not the individual
word, which, apart from its relation to other parts
of the sentence, has no meaning in itself, but the complete
act of reasoning, which on the inward side is called
a judgment, and on the outward side a sentence or proposition.
The single word is to the sentence what syllables
and letters are to the single word. We may
break up a word into the several sounds of which it is
composed, but this is the work of the phonologist, not of
the speaker. So, too, we may break up a sentence like
“Don’t do that” into the four words <i>Do-not-do-that</i>, but
this, again, is the conscious procedure of the grammarian.
Sentences may be of any length; they may consist of a
single syllable, like <i>go!</i> or <i>yes</i>, or they may have to be
expressed by a large number of separate “words”; what
is essential is that they should be significant to another,
should adequately convey to his mind the whole thought
that is intended to be expressed. Unless the sounds we
utter are combined into a sentence, they have no more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
meaning than the cries of the jackal or the yelping of
the cur; and until they have a meaning, and so represent
our thought, they do not constitute language. The
sentence, in short, is the only unit which language can
know, and the ultimate starting-point of all our linguistic
inquiries.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the sentence should be divided
into its component words in writing any more than it
actually is in speech. The French <i>je le vois</i> is as much a
single, undivided group of sounds as the Basque <i>dakust</i>
or the Latin <i>amatur</i>. In the polysynthetic languages of
America, in which the separate words of a sentence are
cut down to their bare stems and fused into a single
whole, the sentence can as little be split up into its
elements as an ordinary compound in Greek or German.
The ancient Hindu grammarians, with that wonderful
insight into language which has made their labours the
basis of modern scientific philology, treated the several
words of a sentence just as we treat syllables and letters.
A number of single words are run into one, the
sounds at the end of each word being modified to suit
those that follow, in accordance with the so-called rules
of Sandhi, and the whole group of words is then written
without division. Thus the word <i>trinairguṇatwamâpannairbadhyante</i>
must be analyzed into <i>trinais</i>, “with grass
blades” (an instrumental pl.), <i>guṇatwam</i>, “a rope’s state”
(acc. sing), <i>â-pannais</i>, “having attained” (part. pass. of
the compound verb <i>â-pad</i>, agreeing with <i>trinais</i>), and
<i>badhyante</i>, “they are bound” (3rd pl. pres. pass. of the
verb <i>bandh</i>). In fact, a little attention will convince
every one that even in our own language not only does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the accent of a word depend upon its place in the sentence,
but that the sound with which it terminates
equally depends upon the sound which follows. We
pronounce “of” in one way when it stands by itself in
the dictionary, in another way when it precedes “the”
or “that.”</p>

<p>If the sentence is the unit of significant speech, it is
evident that all individual words must once have been
sentences; that is to say, when first used they must each
have implied or represented a sentence. And this is
borne out by an examination of the records of speech.
We shall see hereafter that words may be divided into
conceptual or presentative, and pronominal or representative,
and that wherever we can trace back the latter to
their source, we find them to have been originally presentative.
Thus words like “and” or “because” are now
purely symbolic and representative; there was a time,
however, when they denoted the very definite ideas of
“a going further,”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and “by the cause.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Now, if we
look carefully into the nature and essence of these presentative
words, it becomes clear that they were at the
outset so many shorthand notes or summaries of various
sentences. Take, for example, the word <i>memorandum</i>.
Before it can form a part of language, <i>memorandum</i>
must be significant. This can come about only in two
ways. Either we must accompany the utterance of the
word <i>memorandum</i> with gestures which imply “This is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
memorandum,” or “Write a memorandum,” or something
similar, or else we must express the meaning of these
gestures by equivalent words. That is to say, the isolated
word <i>memorandum</i> must be incorporated into a sentence
by being brought into relation with other words, before
it can become part and parcel of living speech. Taken by
itself, it belongs to the dictionary-maker only, and even
he has to add a definition, that is to say, to make it the
subject of a sentence, if his dictionary is to be something
more than a mere catalogue of unmeaning sounds.
Before a definition is supplied by the lexicographer or
the reader, a word is not yet a word; it has no meaning.</p>

<p>The student of language, then, cannot deal with words
apart from sentences. The significant word—that combination
of sounds which represents a thought—is really
a crystallized sentence, a kind of shorthand note in
which a proposition has been summed up. Each advance
in philosophy and science is marked by the acquisition
of a new idea or fact, the result of a long train of previous
observations and reasonings: and the more complex the
idea or the fact, the more numerous will be the reasonings,
the sentences or judgments, which underlie it.
What a multitude of judgments, which when expressed
in language we call sentences, are implied by the two
simple words <i>humanity</i> and <i>gravitation</i>! It is a truism in
psychology that the terms of a proposition, when closely
interrogated, turn out to be nothing but abbreviated
judgments. The ordinary theory of modern comparative
philologists traces all languages back to a certain number
of abstract roots, each of which was a sort of sentence in
embryo, and though this theory is scarcely tenable in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
form in which it is usually presented, it is yet certain
that there was a time in the history of speech when the
articulate or semi-articulate sounds uttered by primitive
man were made the significant representatives of thought
by the gestures with which they were accompanied. And
this complex of sound and gesture—a complex in which,
it must be remembered, the sound had no meaning apart
from the gesture—was the earliest sentence. The isolating
languages of Further India still express a new
concept by the juxtaposition of two words which denote
that it is the species of a higher genus. Thus, in Taic or
Siamese <i>kin</i> is to “eat,” but when <i>nam</i>, “water,” is added,
<i>kin-nam</i> means “to drink;” <i>mi</i> is “rich,” <i>mi din</i>, <i>mi
nám</i>, “earthy,” and “watery,” that is to say, “rich (in)
earth” and “water.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>These examples from the far East show us the way
in which our words first came into existence. They
have grown out of sentences by a process of comparison
and determination. Two or more sentence-words,
referring to the same object or idea viewed
under different relations to the speaker, might be set
over against one another, and the phonetic part in which
they agreed taken to denote the object or idea considered
by itself. Thus in Semitic <i>kâtal</i> is “he killed,”
<i>kotêl</i>, “killing,” <i>k’tol</i>, “to kill” and “kill,” <i>kâtûl</i>, “killed,”
and <i>katl</i>, <i>kitl</i>, or <i>kutl</i>, “a killing,” where the difference
of signification is marked by a difference of vowel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
and co-existing forms of this kind, when compared with
each other, would determine that the three consonants
<i>k-t-l</i> had the general sense of “killing.” But an inflectional
language does not permit us to watch the word-making
process so clearly as do those savage jargons in
which a couple of sounds like the Grebo <i>ni ne</i> signify “I
do it” or “you do it,” according to the context and the
gestures of the speaker. Here by degrees, with the
growth of consciousness and the analysis of thought, the
external gesture is replaced by some portion of the
uttered sounds which agrees in a number of different
instances, and in this way the words by which the relations
of grammar are expressed come into being. A
similar process has been at work in producing those
analogical terminations whereby our Indo-European
languages adapt a word to express a new grammatical
relation. Thus, in English, the Greek termination <i>ize</i> (or
-<i>ise</i>) has been abstracted from the words to which it properly
belonged by comparing them together, and has been
instinctively, as it were, invested with a particular meaning,
so that we can now turn any word we like, whether
of Greek origin or not, into a transitive verb by attaching
to it this suffix. In <i>humanize</i>, for instance, it is added to
an adjective of Latin origin, in <i>jeopardize</i> to a Romanic
compound. When once a sentence-word had been broken
up into single words by comparing it with other sentence-words
relating to the same subject, it was easy to extend
the operation to other sentence-words, which were accordingly
broken up and analyzed without being compared
with related sentences. The phonetic expression of the
verbal copula by which the subject and object were connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
together, was the last result of this analytic
process; it was long left to be supplied by the mind, the
simple juxtaposition of subject and object being considered
sufficient to suggest the mental act by which
they were compared or contrasted, and to this day
many languages, those of Polynesia, for example, still
remain without a verb. Thus, in Dayak <i>kutoh ka-halap-e
arut-m</i>, “thy boat is very beautiful,” is literally “very
its-beauty thy-boat,” <i>andi-m handak imukul-ku</i>, “thy
brother will be struck by me,” means properly, “thy-brother
my striking-being,” while to express “he has a
white jacket on,” the Dayak must say, <i>ia ba-klambi ba-puti</i>,
“he with-jacket with-white.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>As we shall see hereafter, all the facts at our disposal
tend to show that the roots of speech, or at all events
the earliest sentence-words out of which the later languages
of mankind have sprung, were polysyllabic, and
other facts go equally towards proving that the terminations
of these primitive roots or sentence-words displayed
a wearisome monotony of agreement. Survivals, as
Mr. Tylor has happily termed them, are among the most
valuable means we have of arguing back to an earlier
state of things, and we can only treat as a survival the
habit of a child whom I know, who in her first essays at
speech affixed a final <i>ö</i> to almost all her words, saying
for instance, <i>come-ö</i> and <i>dog-ö</i> for “come” and “dog.”
The older a speech is, the more it has suffered from the
wasting and wearing effects of time, and a language like
the Chinese, which stands out as some weather-beaten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
granite peak among the languages of a later day, has so
concealed all traces of the originally pluriliteral character
of its vocabulary, that it is only within the last few years
that Sinologues, like Dr. Edkins and M. de Rosny, have
detected it. So, we may infer, will it also be found
with all the other languages of the world; the first
utterances of mankind were polysyllabic, though not
perhaps of such monstrous length as the sentence-words
of Eskimaux or Algonquin. In the friction and comparison
of these utterances similar terminations came in
some instances to be set apart to denote the relations of
grammar; in other instances the grammatical relations
which lay implicit in the sentence-word were made
explicit by its being set over against another sentence-word
similarly employed elsewhere; and so it came in
course of time to be what the Chinese would call an
“empty word” with no presentative meaning of its own.
Thus, on the one side, as M. Bergaigne has shown, the
old adjectival suffix <i>bha</i> (<i>bhi</i>) in our own family of speech
has become the sign of the dative and genitive cases
(Latin <i>ti-bi</i>, dat., Old Slavonic <i>te-be</i>, gen.) just as the
adjectival termination <i>sya</i> or <i>tya</i> (as in δημόσιος, “belonging
to the people”) has become the sign of the genitive
(ἱππο[σ]ιο); while, on the other side, the Chinese <i>tsĭ̥ h‘ai</i>,
“to be hurt,” is literally “eat hurt,” and <i>tshyeu tha̤n</i>,
“autumn,” “harvest-heaven.” The Chinese word can
still be used indifferently as a noun, a verb, an adverb or
the sign of a case much like such English words as <i>silver</i>
and <i>picture</i>, and its place in the sentence alone determines
in what sense it shall be construed. This is an
excellent illustration of the early days of speech, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the sentence-words contained within themselves all the
several parts of speech at once—all that was needed for
a complete sentence; and it was only by bringing them
into contact and contrast with other sentence-words,
that they came to be restricted in their meaning and use,
and to be reduced into mere “words.” Language never
forgot the mode in which it had framed its first vocabulary,
and the Greek and Roman, as much as the Red
Indian of America, in framing their compounds instinctively
stripped off the so-called inflections, and reduced
the word they placed first to its simple stem. That part
alone of the word which remained unchanged and unchangeable,
could be made use of when the word was to
be treated as simply a word and nothing more. The
North American languages reflect more faithfully than
the languages of the Old World the primitive condition
of speech, and the North American languages can
possess from six to eight thousand different verbal forms
or sentences without having abstracted from them a
single <i>word</i> which will express the sense of the verb out
of all relation to anything else.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Thus, the Cheroki has
thirteen verbs to denote particular kinds of “washing,”
such as “washing the head,” or “the hands,” or “myself,”
and each of these verbs has a multitude of forms, but no
isolated word to denote “washing” in general has as yet
been extracted from them.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The difficulty has often
been noticed of getting a savage or barbarian to give the
name of an object without incorporating it into a sentence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
or bringing it into relation with something else. Thus, a
Kurd who supplied Dr. Sandwith with a vocabulary of the
Zaza dialect, was so little able to conceive of words like
“head,” “father,” “hair,” except as related to himself or
some one else, that he had to combine them with a personal
pronoun, saying <i>sèrè-min</i>, “my head,” <i>piè-min</i>, “my
father,” <i>porè-min</i>, “my hair.” The Hoopah and Navaho
vocabularies, published by Schoolcraft,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> similarly prefix
the possessive pronoun <i>h’</i>, <i>hut</i> to all their words, as
<i>hotsintah</i>, <i>hut-tah</i>, “forehead,” <i>huanah</i>, <i>hunnah</i>, “eye,”
<i>hoithlani</i>, <i>hutcon</i>, “arm;” and Dr. Latham points out the
same fact in Wallace’s vocabularies from the river Uapes,
where <i>eri-bida</i>, <i>eri-numa</i> in Uainambeu, <i>tcho-kereu</i>,
<i>tcho-ia</i> in Juri, and <i>no-dusia</i>, <i>no-nunia</i> in Barrè, literally
“my head,” “my mouth,” are given as the equivalents of
simple “head” and “mouth.” He also states that he has
noticed the same peculiarity among the English Gipsies.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
The making of words as distinct from sentences was a
long and laborious process, and there are many languages
like those of North America in which the process has
hardly yet begun. A dictionary is the result of reflection,
and ages must elapse before a language can enter upon
its reflective stage. Our children still learn the languages
they speak by first acquiring the knowledge of certain
phrases and sentences, and then gradually analyzing
them into words, and the adult who wishes to gain a successful
acquaintance with another tongue must pursue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the same plan. What Steinthal says of the Chinese, that
its “smallest real whole is a sentence, or at least a sentence-relation,”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
is true of other languages as well, and
the words of which a sentence is composed have no
actual existence apart from that sentence, except for the
phonologist and the lexicographer. Until the whole
sentence is completed the individual words of which it
consists have no more signification than the syllables <i>ful</i>
and <i>ness</i> or <i>cy</i> and <i>ly</i> which occur so plentifully in English.
The first condition of language is that it should be significant,
and words are only significant when they stand
in relation to one another. The <i>logos</i>, the true word, said
Aristotle, was the cause of knowledge; the individual
words of which it was composed were but symbols and
tokens of the impressions of sense.</p>

<p>Now, if language be the embodiment of thought, and if
thought can only express itself under the form of the
complete sentence, it is plain that we must look to the
sentence for a true classification of languages. The sentence
expresses the way in which we think, and the different
forms assumed by the sentence—that is to say,
the different modes in which the relations of subject,
object, and verb are denoted will constitute the only
sound basis for classifying speech. The particular relation
between the several ideas summed up in a judgment
or sentence agrees with the manner in which we
regard the objects about which we think and speak. If,
for instance, we have no clear idea of any distinction between
ourselves and the objects around us, in talking
about them any reference to ourselves will be left out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
sight. Instead of saying, “<i>I</i> am running,” where the
speaker distinguishes himself from the act in which he is
engaged, we should say like the Romans <i>curro</i>, where the
personal pronoun has no separate and independent mark
of its own. Different races of men do not think in the
same way; and, consequently, the forms taken by the
sentence in different languages are not the same. Thus
in the so-called isolating languages, the separate terms
or ideas which make up the sentence are not subordinated
to each other, and fused into a single whole, but every
word remains a separate and distinct sentence. The
Chinaman has to say, “<i>thya̤n-hi le̥ṅ tsyaṅ-s̆aṅ-lei</i>”-literally,
“heaven-air cold begin-rise-come,”—if he wants to
state that “the weather began to be cold;” and the Burman’s
way of expressing “we are going,” is by saying,
“<i>ṅā dō dhwā kra dhań</i>”—“I multitude go multitude
which.” In cases such as these, the ideas are each set
down independently, instead of being subordinated one
to another, and the words which embody them are accordingly
contrasted with each other like so many independent
sentences. On the other hand, in the agglutinative languages,
the ideas which make up the sentence, though
still kept distinct and independent, are no longer set over
against one another, but brought into mutual relation
and harmony, and regarded as of equal force and meaning.
The root or stem still stands out clearly and separately,
and the suffixes of relation are marked with equal
distinctness; But for all that, the inward fact of the incipient
subordination which exists between them is denoted
by the outward fact of vocalic harmony, whereby
the vowels of both stem and suffix have to belong to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
same class. The Turkish sign of the infinitive, <i>mak</i>, has
to become <i>mek</i> after a root like <i>sev</i>, “love,” though both
root and suffix still retain their own individuality; and
while <i>at-lar</i> is “horses,” <i>ev-ler</i> is “houses.” The grammatical
relations expressed in the Aryan class of languages
by case-endings and person-endings, or by prefixed
pronouns and prepositions, have to be represented,
as a general rule, by postfixes, since in no other way can
sufficient emphasis be laid upon them, and the danger
avoided of their being swallowed up in the verb or noun.
Our “I love,” or “the man,” look but little different in
writing from the Turkish <i>sev-r-im</i>, or the Basque <i>gizoná</i>,
<i>gizonák</i>; the case is quite altered, however, when we try
to pronounce these words, the accent falling on the verb
in our “I love,” but allowing the distinction between
verb and pronoun to be clearly felt in the Turkish <i>sevrim</i>.
It is among the inhabitants of mountainous and cold
regions in the Aryan and Semitic families of speech—among
Albanians, Bulgarians, Scandinavians, and Aramæans—that
the definite article is postfixed instead of
being prefixed; and we can see at once what an emphasis
and distinctness would be given to it by such a
position. Only where foreign influences have been at
work do the agglutinative languages change the order of
the words in the sentence and, as in the case of the Hungarian
definite article <i>a</i>, <i>az</i>, prefix the words expressive of
the grammatical relations, instead of postfixing them.
Still further, to mark out the several parts or terms of
the sentence, the objective pronoun may be inserted between
the subjective pronoun and the verbal root or
stem; and so we may have a sentence-word like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
French <i>je vous donne</i>, as in the Basque <i>zamaztet</i> (from
<i>eman</i>, “to give”), or the converse arrangement of the
terms, as in <i>n-aza-zu-n</i>, “that you may have me” (“me-have-you-may”).
The incorporating languages, as they
are called, are the oldest examples of the agglutinative
class, for they go back to the time when the speaker had
not yet begun to analyze his sentences, and when he
could not say simply, “I give,” without finishing the sentence
with the objective pronoun. Hence it is that in
Basque we must say <i>dituzte beren liburnac</i>, “they have
them their books,” instead of simply “they have their
books;” and in Accadian, the language of primitive
Chaldea, “I built a house” would be <i>ê mu-n-rû</i>,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> literally
“house I-it-built.”</p>

<p>Very distinct from these incorporating tongues are
the polysynthetic or incapsulating dialects of America,
in which the words that make up a sentence are
stripped of their grammatical terminations, and then
fused into a single word of monstrous length and appearance.
Thus the Algonquin would say, <i>wut-ap-pé-sit-tuk-quś-sun-noo-weht-unḱ-quoh</i>,
if he wished to express the
sentence “he, falling on his knees, worshipped him;”
and this cumbrous compound denotes exactly what we
split up into seven words. These polysynthetic languages
are an interesting survival of the early condition of language
everywhere, and are but a fresh proof that America
is in truth “the <i>new</i> world.” Primitive forms of speech
that have elsewhere perished long ago still survive there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
like the armadillo, to bear record of a bygone past. The
conception of the sentence that underlies the polysynthetic
dialects is the precise converse of that which underlies
the isolating or the agglutinative groups. The several
ideas into which the sentence may be analyzed, instead
of being made equal or independent, are combined like a
piece of mosaic into a single whole. The sentence has
not passed beyond its primitive form, or rather that
primitive form has been retained in spite of the growth
and development of the languages to which it belongs. It
is possible that the Eskimaux may be the descendants of
the savage races who inhabited the caves of southern
France, when the rivers were stiff with ice for half the
year, and the reindeer roamed freely through the woods
and meers; at all events, among the icebergs and dark
winters of the North, they have preserved their old habits
of thought, their old mode of viewing the world about
them, almost unchanged. And yet our own class of
speech, that class to which we give the name inflectional,
and which we sometimes think is the crown and standard
of all other kinds of language, is not so far removed in
usage from the Eskimaux or the Algonquin as are the
isolating dialects of China and the agglutinative jargons
of Mongol and Turk. In the inflectional group the words
or suffixes which denote grammatical relations are subordinated
to the words which express objects or actions—that
is to say, to nouns and verbs. The termination of
the Latin <i>currit</i> has lost all distinct and independent
meaning of its own; apart from the verbal stem to which
it is subordinated, it is a mere <i>flatus vocis</i>, a mere empty
sound. In flection proper, which we may see best exemplified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
in the Semitic tongues, the relations of grammar
are denoted by internal vowel change—<i>adamu</i>,
“man,” for instance, being nominative, <i>adami</i> genitive,
and <i>adama</i> accusative. It was only afterwards, and by
the force of analogy, that first unmeaning suffixes and
then agglutinated words which were gradually assimilated
to them, came to take the place of internal vowel change.
What we may term the inflectional instinct sought to express
the various relations of the sentence, as they successively
rose to consciousness, out of the original sentence-word
itself. When separate words like <i>wards</i> or <i>ly</i>
(<i>like</i>) were afterwards employed for the same purpose,
they first had to lose their own individuality, to become
empty words, representative and not presentative, and as
such to be engrafted upon the old stems. The Greek
φη-μί, or the Sanskrit <i>ad-mi</i>, “I eat,” are single wholes;
the first personal pronoun <i>ma</i>, weakened to <i>mi</i>, has lost
all life of its own, and its sole right to existence lies in
its absorption into the stems φη- and <i>ad</i>-. But an inflectional
language cannot carry out its fundamental
principle with logical completeness. All the subordinate
relations of a sentence cannot be brought into the same
close connection with the principal idea as in φημί and
<i>admi</i>. Sentences like “I speak” or “I eat” may be comprehended
under a single word; but there are many sentences
where this is impossible, and where the attempt to
express in language the relation between the principal
and the subordinate, between the subject and the attribute,
has to be given up. In the Latin <i>poeta bonus</i>, for
example, the subject and the attribute appear as separate
words; and there is nothing in the flection attached to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
each to show that they stand in any relation whatsoever
one to the other. So far as the form goes there is nothing
to tell us whether the two words mean “a good poet” or
“the poet is good.” The fundamental principle of flection
has been violated, and the language is on the high road
to that more developed condition in which, as in Chinese,
the two ideas are set plainly and distinctly one against
the other, and the mind is left to supply the relation between
them. This impossibility of carrying out thoroughly
the principle of flection brings about an analytic
tendency in all inflectional forms of speech. The longer
an inflectional language lives the more analytic it becomes.
The Englishman says “I will go,” and the
Frenchman <i>le monde</i>, where the Latin was contented
with <i>ibo</i> and <i>mundus</i>. One by one the grammatical relations
implied in an inflectional compound are brought
out, as it were, into full relief, and provided with special
forms in which to be expressed; but the change that
has taken place is but an apparent one, the inflectional
spirit of the language still remains; and though we write
“he runs,” “I will go,” we pronounce as if they were
single words. The pronoun and the verb, taken apart
and by themselves, convey no meaning to our minds;
we have to combine them before they become significant,
and (the order of the words excepted) there is but
slight difference between an English sentence like “never
to be sufficiently relied upon,” and the Tamil <i>sārndāykku</i>,
“to thee that hast approached,” to be analyzed into
<i>sār</i>, “approach,” <i>d</i> sign of the past, <i>āy</i>, “thee,” and <i>ku</i>,
“to.”</p>

<p>Each of the leading classes of speech naturally comprises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
various species or subdivisions. Thus the isolating
Chinese differs from the isolating dialects of Further
India, in that the Chinese mode of expressing the relations
of the sentence by position is replaced in these by
the use of words like <i>prū</i>, “do;” <i>khã</i>, “suffer;” <i>khōṅ</i>,
“possession,” <i>mha</i>, “from.” So, again, in the agglutinative
class, the Bâ-ntu languages of Southern Africa prefix
the same substantive, worn down, it may be, to a mere
unmeaning symbol, to each of the words in a sentence
which have to be brought into relation with each other;
<i>o</i>-ka-<i>ti</i> k-<i>etu</i> <i>o</i>-ka-<i>ua</i>, for instance, being “our fine stick,”
or literally, “stick ours fine.” The Malayo-Polynesian
dialects have not yet attained to the conception of the
verb; thus <i>yaku imukul olo</i> (“I smitten people”) is “I
am smitten by the people;” <i>iṅga̤ra̤-ku ia̤ tatau</i> (“my-thought
he rich”) “I thought he is rich;” <i>ia̤ baklambi
baputi</i> (“he with-jacket with-white”) “he has a white
jacket on.” Basque grammarians generally hold that the
Basque has but two verbs, “to be” and “to have,” while,
on the other hand, there are many languages which lack
precisely these two.</p>

<p>But in all these sub-classes, just as in the main classes
of speech, it is the different conception of the sentence
and the form it takes which characterize the
whole language. However much alike may have been
the circumstances by which the first communities of
men were surrounded, they yet viewed the world without
them and their own relation to it with different eyes.
The idea they formed of the sentence and its parts was
not the same everywhere. When with the growth of
consciousness came also the formal expression in utterance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
of the relations of the several parts of the sentence,
it was inevitable that this expression should clothe itself
in essentially various forms. And the psychological
peculiarity which originated each of these forms—a peculiarity
itself the result of previous experiences and
tendencies—became continually more definite, more confirmed,
more unalterable. The logician may reduce all
forms of the affirmative proposition or judgment to the
single “A is B,” but the grammarian knows that this is
like the <i>jus gentium</i> of the Romans, a mere abstraction
from a limited number of observed instances. It may be
the right form for the sentence to take in the manifold
languages of the world, but as a matter of fact it has
never been taken in any one of them. The form of the
sentence as shaped by the primitive language-builders of
each human community has imprinted itself indelibly
upon the linguistic consciousness of their successors.
Racial type and characteristics will change as soon as
the conception of the sentence. Many of the agglutinative
languages have approached so nearly to the phænomena
of inflection, as to make it difficult to determine
why they should not be classed with the inflectional
tongues; and yet for all that they remain agglutinative,
and have remained so as far back as we can trace them.
Our own language is agglutinative, and even isolating in
many respects, while the French <i>je vous donne</i> seems a
clear instance of incorporation. The Chinese, on the
other hand, shows much that is agglutinative, much even
that resembles inflection, and it is only the polysynthetic
languages of America that remain true to their stereotyped
primæval character. Nevertheless, in spite of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
this apparent confusion and overlapping, this borrowing,
as it were, of characteristics from other families of
speech, the great types of language stand out each of
them visibly and distinctly. Their broad characteristics
can be clearly sketched, their essential diversity easily
felt. It is only when we come to map out the boundaries
between them, to determine where isolation ends and
agglutination begins, that we find ourselves at fault.
Here as elsewhere in nature there is no sharply-defined
line of division to be drawn; species passes gradually
and insensibly into species, class into class. But in spite
of this, species and classes really exist, each with its own
type and characteristics, each founded upon its own conception
of the sentence and its parts. When we remember
that the sentence, and not the isolated word, is the
starting-point of philology—when we make it what the
logician would term the <i>fundamentum divisionis</i> for our
classification of speech—there is no longer any difficulty
in distinguishing between the several families of speech,
and assigning to each its character and place. The
Finnic idioms have become so nearly inflectional as to
have led a recent scholar to suggest their relationship to
our Aryan group; nevertheless, they have never cleared
the magical frontier between flection and agglutination,
hard as it may be to define, since to pass from agglutination
to inflection is to revolutionize the whole system of
thought and language and the basis on which it rests,
and to break with the past psychological history and
tendencies of a speech. There are South American
butterflies whose colours have come to resemble so
closely those of the plants on which they are found as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
to be indistinguishable from them; for all that, the butterfly
still remains a butterfly, and the plant a plant.</p>

<p>Such, then, is language in its origin and its nature. It
is significant sound, the outward embodiment and expression,
however imperfect, of thought. Before sound
can become significant it must express the whole thought
or judgment; that is, it must take the form of a sentence.
Historically, the sentence and not the word
comes first. The sentence consists of two factors, one
the external sound, the other the internal thought, and
neither of these factors can be disregarded by a true
science of language.</p>

<p>Now, science is accurate knowledge. The statement
may seem a truism, but it is a truism which has sometimes
been forgotten. For that which is accurate is only
that which can be defined and limited, that of which all
the boundaries, as it were, are distinctly mapped out and
known. But the boundaries of knowledge can only be discovered
by the help of comparison. It is, in fact, the comparative
method that constitutes the very life of inductive
science; it is the application of the comparative method
to any subject which brings that subject within the domain
of scientific knowledge. Our knowledge that night
and day follow one another alternately, or that if we put
our hands into the fire they will be burnt, is not yet
scientific. In order to know anything scientifically we
must be able to compare it with something else, and so
determine its size, or weight, or character. Our feelings
may tell us that the atmosphere is hot or cold, but we
have no scientific knowledge of either fact until we can
measure one degree of heat or cold against another by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
means of the thermometer. As soon as we know the
exact amount and character of each degree of heat or
cold, we have laid the foundations of a science of thermology.
It is just the same in the case of language.
Here, too, as soon as we can compare languages and the
elements of languages together, and so measure and determine
their character, we shall have the beginning of a
science of language. But the comparison must be made
by the aid of a common standard. The old attempts to
compare Latin with Greek, or both with Hebrew, were
failures because the test applied was a capricious one,
depending on the subjective fancies and prejudices of the
inquirer. We cannot compare two things together without
having a third term—a common standard by which
to measure them. We must not have one rule and
measure for one set of words or languages and another
rule and measure for another set. The comparative
method we employ must be alike in all cases.</p>

<p>Language is a social product, at once the creation and
the creator of society. It is independent of the caprice
of the single individual, and the Emperor Tiberius could
no more change a Latin word<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> than the slavish obedience
of a Benedictine monastery could turn <i>sumpsimus</i>
into <i>mumpsimus</i>. Unless the community as a body
agree to accept the new word or form, Cæsar himself is
powerless to introduce it. The changes undergone by
language are brought about by the action of circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
over which the individual has no control. They
are circumstances which affect the whole community, not
the individual member of it. The primary condition
of speech that it should be significant requires that it
should be stamped and recognized by the common
consciousness. Now, the circumstances that affect a
whole community will always act in the same way should
the conditions remain the same. Individual caprice is
rendered impossible, and the forms assumed by language
will be found referable to general laws. We have to
deal, not with the infinite complexity of individual
motives and caprice, but with the consentient action of
many minds swayed by the same feelings, surrounded
by the same atmosphere. The joint action of a multitude
eliminates the accidental differences of individual
character; all that is left is just that in which all agree,
the result of the influences of which all alike are sensible.
The circumstances that determine the common nature of
a society determine also its common utterance, and this
common utterance we call its language. It embodies all
the past life and history of the community that speaks
it; each phase in the development of its speakers is reflected
in it as in a mirror, and its worn-out words and
forms are so many crystallized embodiments of dead
and bygone thought, so many fossil relics, as it were, of
the past strata of social growth. The facts of language—its
sentences and its words—are the result of the action
of general laws and conditions; by comparing and
classifying them we can discover what these general laws
are, and how they act. A knowledge of these laws
and their action constitutes glottology or the science<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
of language; the use of the comparative method by
which they are discovered constitutes comparative philology.</p>

<p>Comparative philology, therefore, furnishes the materials
whereby the science of language investigates such
questions as the origin of speech, the nature of roots, or
the meaning of flection. It may be said to comprise
both comparative and historical grammar, comparative
grammar being primarily occupied in comparing the
grammatical forms and syntax of different languages of
the same group; historical grammar in tracing the
history of the forms and syntax of a single language.
The two studies, however, necessarily overlap, comparative
grammar requiring a knowledge of the individual
languages compared at the successive periods of their
history, or restoring the older forms of the individual
languages by means of comparison, and historical
grammar calling in the aid of the allied dialects to
supply the deficiencies of the literary or monumental
record. Quite apart from either is philology proper in
the old sense of the word, which busied itself solely with
literary languages and the literature they enshrine. The
business of philology is to compare author with author,
style with style, to determine the employment of words
and phrases in the writers it investigates and pronounce
upon their correctness, to emend the readings of
MSS. and imitate the idiosyncrasies of particular writers.
From the old-fashioned classical philology to the so-called
philosophy of speech there is a wide leap, but
both have been equally transformed by the new comparative
method. The philosophy of speech in the hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
of men like Harris or Stoddart<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> endeavoured to attack
the problems of language by “the high <i>priori</i> road,” and
by unverified and unverifiable reasoning from the phænomena
of modern dialects to discover the origin of
speech and the relation between grammar and logic.
The philosophy of speech under the guidance of comparative
philology has become the science of language,
which may be said to comprehend both. The questions
which the <i>à priori</i> method failed to resolve are now
yielding their answers to <i>à posteriori</i> research, and the
results already obtained have overthrown the unsubstantial
speculations of the last century. The science of
language has been variously termed “La Linguistique,”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
“Linguistic Science,” Glottic,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and Glottology,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and it
stands in the same relation to comparative philology
that physiology stands to comparative anatomy.</p>

<p>Now, the ultimate facts with which comparative philology
has to deal are sentences and the words that have
been evolved out of them. These words and sentences
must be real and not imaginary—that is, they must
either belong to some living speech, or be preserved in a
written record, or else be restored by a sound comparison
of existing words which presuppose some common ancestor.
Where such real and well-attested words are not to
be had, no conclusions can be drawn. Unless inscribed
monuments are hereafter brought to light or comparison
with the Malayan dialects results in the recovery of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
common parent-speech, the condition of the Polynesian
languages 1,000 years ago must remain unknown. Much
no doubt may be effected by comparing the scattered
relics of these languages together, by showing that a
sibilant, for instance, has been preserved in Samoan
which has become a simple aspirate elsewhere, or that a
guttural is retained between two vowels in Maori which
has been dropped in most of the other Polynesian settlements;
but to assert that some thousand years back
they resembled another language to which they bear
little similarity at present, would be to argue without
data, and to violate the fundamental principles of comparative
philology.</p>

<p>The object of the science of language is threefold:—</p>

<p>(1). It compares and classifies sentences, grammatical
relations and words.</p>

<p>(2). It compares and classifies languages and dialects.</p>

<p>(3). By means of this comparison and classification it
discovers the laws which govern language in general and
certain languages and dialects in particular.</p>

<p>Thus by comparing the languages of the Aryan family
we discover the phonetic law that an English <i>th</i> must
always represent <i>t</i> in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, unless
the action of other determinate laws interfere, and by
comparing different groups of languages together, we
find that the dual number everywhere preceded the
plural. There are still many tongues in which the plural
is formed by reduplication, tongues, that is, where duality,
the repetition of the idea, is or has been the only conception
of plurality yet reached; and others in which
the number “three” is denoted by words like <i>prica</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
“many” (in the dialect of the Puris of South America,)
expressive of vague indefiniteness, and an inability to
form a clear idea of anything beyond “two.” Indeed, in
our own Aryan family of speech there was a time when
<i>one</i>, and <i>two</i>, or that which was “divided” (δύω, δίς, διὰ, &amp;c.)
from one, were the only numerals known, and it required
a fresh effort of thought to attain and conceive of a new
numeral, which was accordingly named <i>tri</i>, <i>tres</i>, <i>three</i>, or
that which is “beyond” (<i>trans</i>, <i>through</i>, Sansk., <i>tar-â-mi</i>,
“I pass beyond”).</p>

<p>The laws of speech may be either primary or empirical.
Empirical laws are those generalizations made from the
survey of a limited number of phænomena, the reason of
which we do not know. All we know is that given one
particular fact, another particular fact follows, or that
wherever we meet with a particular class of phænomena
the same generalization is sure to hold good. Thus in
astronomy, Kepler’s discovery that the planets move in
an ellipse may be termed an empirical law, and the same
may be said of the phonetic law mentioned above which
obliges us to compare an English <i>th</i> with the Greek and
Latin <i>t</i>. Primary laws are those higher and more comprehensive
laws or generalizations which embrace the
empirical laws and give the reason of them. Such a
primary law is gravitation, such, too, probably is the law
of natural selection. In the science of language examples
of these primary laws would be the law that all language
is based on roots, or the law of economy in the use of
speech. The determination of the primary laws of language
leads us very nearly into the charmed land of
metaphysic; as the physicist with his doctrine of force<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
is transported out of the region of pure experiment and
observation, and brought face to face with metaphysical
problems, so is the scientific student of language with
his doctrine of roots. Hence that part of the science of
language which stands in the most direct relation with
the old philosophy of speech, which would investigate
such subjects as the origin of gender and case, or determine
the priority of thought or language, has sometimes
been called linguistic metaphysics.</p>

<p>When once the laws of language have been laid down
we are able to apply them to our facts (that is, words
and sentences), to whatever period these belong. The
science of language, like all other sciences, rests upon
the postulate of uniformity. So long as the conditions
remain the same, the laws of the science will act with
undeviating regularity. It does not matter whether the
words we are dealing with are still living and spoken,
or have been dead and obsolete for thousands of years;
if we can show that they fall under the action of a particular
law, we can apply that law to them in either case
with equal certainty. When once we have ascertained
that an English <i>d</i> represents a Sanskrit <i>t</i>, only those
Sanskrit words which contain a <i>t</i> must be compared
with English words of Teutonic origin which have a <i>d</i>
in the corresponding place, whatever their antiquity may
be. A knowledge that an English <i>d</i> answers to a Sanskrit
and Latin <i>t</i>, and an English <i>h</i> to a Sanskrit and
Latin <i>c</i> (<i>k</i> or <i>ś</i>) shows that the English <i>hundred</i> has the
same origin as the Latin <i>centum</i>, and the Sanskrit <i>śatam</i>,
and that, consequently, our linguistic ancestors were
able to count as far as one hundred before they separated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
from each other, the one to conquer India, the
other to occupy Europe. Words, in fact, are like the
fossils of the rocks; they embody the thought and
knowledge of the society that first coined and used them,
and if we can find out their primitive meaning by the
aid of the comparative method, we shall know the character
of the society that produced them, and the degree
of civilization it had attained. The palæontologist can
reconstruct the animal life of the past ages of the globe
with no greater ease than the comparative philologist
can reconstruct the life of bygone and forgotten communities.
If the fragment of a fossil bone can tell us
the history of an extinct world, so, too, can the fragment
of a word reveal to us the struggles of ancient societies,
and ideas and beliefs that have long since perished.</p>

<p>But the laws of a science must be verified before they
can be accepted as such. However brilliant or ingenious
a hypothesis may be, it remains a hypothesis, more
or less probable, until it has been verified by experiment
and observation. It is to history, to psychology,
and to physiology that the science of language has to
look for the verification of its laws. In the phonautograph
of König, or the phonograph of Edison, we can
discover the very forms assumed by the waves of air
set in motion by each sound we utter; and the first
lessons of psychology confirm the conclusion of glottology,
that the concrete precedes the abstract. Sometimes
it is not so much the law, the generalization itself,
that can best be verified; but the application of it to
the phænomena of speech. Thus, a sound application of
the laws of language makes it clear that the words possessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
in common by Spanish and Arabic are not due to
a common ancestry, but to contact between the two
tongues, and the history of the Moorish conquest of
Spain confirms the conclusion.</p>

<p>But we may ask, What is meant precisely by that
comparison of words and sentences on which the laws
of language are said to rest? A word, a sentence, a
grammatical form, consists of two elements, one, the articulate
utterance, the other, the signification or thought
which the utterance symbolizes. Sound and sense are
the two factors which make up speech, and it is, therefore,
in respect of both sound and sense that our comparisons
have to be made. Comparative philology divides
itself into phonology and sematology, to which,
perhaps, we may also add morphology. Phonology is
the science of sounds, sematology the science of meanings,
and morphology the science of grammatical forms.
But inasmuch as grammatical forms are but a combination
of the relations of the sentence (or rather of the
meaning those relations convey to the mind) and of the
phonetic sounds by which they are expressed, morphology
may be strictly included partly under phonology, partly
under sematology. We must never forget that the study
of sounds is intended to be the vestibule through which
we approach the thought within. The phonological investigations
we carry on, the phonological laws we formulate,
are the outworks by which we may storm the
fortress of the inward signification. They enable us to
trace to a common source words that have flowed
through diverse regions, or to discover the origin of some
strangely-changed form of grammar, but the value they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
possess is the value that belonged to the magic ring of
the Nibelungs: it gives access to the treasure, but is
not the treasure itself. Phonology is not commensurate
with comparative philology, as seems sometimes to be
thought. It forms but one side of the science, the instrument
by which we discover the true force and meaning
of sentences and words.</p>

<p>As the instrument of linguistic science, however, phonology
is of the highest importance. In fact the modern
science of language is wholly based upon it, and that
which distinguishes comparative philology from the
abortive attempts of former centuries is its scientific investigation
into the laws of articulate utterance and of
phonetic change. Here, and almost here only, we can
as yet trace the nature and working of the laws of speech.
It is only because we know that an English <i>h</i> and <i>d</i>
must answer to a Sanskrit <i>k</i> (<i>ś</i>) and <i>t</i> that we are able
to assert that the primitive Aryan community had
attained the conception of “one hundred.” Sematology
is still in a far more backward state; its laws are still a
subject of investigation, and the differences of opinion
that exist as to some of the great questions of linguistic
science show only too plainly how much in this department
of it still remains to be done. But the relative
position of phonology and sematology is, after all, but
natural. Phonology deals with the outward and physical,
that which, can be weighed and measured, and
imitated by mechanical contrivances; sematology belongs
to the inward and the spiritual—to that realm
of thought, in short, which can only be examined in so
far as it makes itself accessible to the inspection of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
senses, and submits itself to the action of physical laws.
Thought seems infinite, manifold, and free, determining
and determined by itself. Like the wind, it “bloweth
where it listeth;” we hear “the sound thereof, but cannot
tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth.” All
the capriciousness and complex mobility of the individual
appears to belong to it; we may formulate the
laws of thinking, but not of the forms which that thinking
takes. The vocal organs, on the other hand, through
which thought becomes realized in speech, are subject to
all the conditions of the material world. The utterance
of each articulate sound and its relations to another are
conditioned and defined by the physical constitution of
man, by the circumstances in which he finds himself, and
by measurable laws of sound. The outward form of
language, the flesh-garment, as it were, in which thought
clothes itself, falls entirely into the domain of physiology
and acoustics. Here we can observe and experimentalize,
can weigh and measure, can even reproduce artificially
for ourselves. Every consonant and vowel can
be accurately determined, the machinery and effort
needed to produce them precisely known, the variations
they are capable of exactly ascertained. But when we
turn to the informing thought, to that inner essence
which gives life and reality to each modulation of articulate
sound, all appears different. What wonder that the
science of significations should be so far behind the science
of sounds?</p>

<p>Let us not forget, however, that thought, in so far as it
finds its expression in language, is not so infinitely free
and capricious as we might at first sight suppose. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
very fact of its finding expression in language, that is,
of being embodied in articulate sounds, implies restraint
and submission to conditions. Thought is thus, as it were,
arrested and crystallized; it is only gradually and in
consequence of ascertainable causes that the signification
attached to a particular sound or group of sounds comes
to be changed. That these sounds should symbolize
certain ideas is, after all, a matter of convention; it
follows from the tacit agreement, not indeed of isolated
individuals, but of individuals as forming a society.
Changes, therefore, in the signification of words and
sentences can only result from causes which affect the
whole society, and as such causes necessarily work slowly
and by degrees, significant change can accordingly be
brought under the action of general laws. But these laws
can only be established by the help of phonology: until
we know what words and forms the laws of phonology
will allow us to compare together and refer to a common
origin, we cannot begin to discuss the genesis and history
of the significations they bear. No doubt structure, that
is, the conception of the sentence formed by a language,
and the order in which the several parts of a sentence are
arranged, is a very important element in the classification
of languages; still it is only one element, and unless
phonology prove that the roots and derivatives of two
idioms are related, no amount of structural similarity will
justify us in deriving them from the same stock.</p>

<p>Phonology, then, is the key and mainstay of modern
linguistic science; it guarantees the correctness of the
results already obtained, and is the indispensable preliminary
to future researches. As will be shown in a later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
chapter, our knowledge of sounds and their laws is now
tolerably complete. So, too, is the application of this
knowledge to certain groups of language. The phonological
laws of the Aryan family, for instance, are pretty
well ascertained; we know what sounds in one member
of the family answer to other sounds in another member,
and what particular changes of sound are permissible
within each of the several members themselves. It follows
from the physical formation of the organs of speech
that the various sounds capable of being articulated are
limited in number. Prince Lucien Bonaparte has enumerated
as many as 385, though some of these are not to
be met with in any known language or dialect.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The
number of different sounds occurring in any single language
is not large among European languages; for instance,
Modern Greek, Spanish, and Illyrian have but
five vowel-sounds, while Gaelic, which has the largest
number, possesses twenty-one, Portuguese and English
following next with nineteen a-piece. So far as consonantal
sounds are concerned the number tends to
diminish with the culture and age of a language, and
the evidence of facts is against identifying the hypothetical
alphabet to which the sounds of the various Aryan
dialects can be reduced with the actual alphabet of
the parent Aryan speech. The physical formation of
our vocal organs, due to climate, food, habit, and inherited
aptitudes, obliges us to pronounce in a particular
way. There are sounds, for instance, which birds and
animals can make, but we cannot; while nothing is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
harder than to catch and reproduce the exact pronunciation
of a foreign tongue. The Polynesian turns David into
<i>Raviri</i>, Samuel into <i>Hemara</i>, London into <i>Ranana</i>, and
Frederick into <i>Waratariki</i>, and the word <i>steel</i> has been
adopted in the Sandwich Islands in the shape of <i>tila</i>. It
has been said that a foreigner can never speak another
language so perfectly as to conceal all traces of his origin,
and though this is going too far, it is quite certain that
there are languages the pronunciation of which can never
be thoroughly acquired after the age when growth has
ended and the organs of speech have ceased to be plastic.
There are numerous sounds which particular races or individuals
are unable to imitate successfully; and those
who have watched the attempt of children to learn their
mother-tongue know how slowly some special sound
is often acquired, and how in some cases it is never
acquired at all. The sound which one person will pronounce
as <i>r</i> will be pronounced <i>l</i> by another. Thus, the
Chinese change every <i>l</i> into <i>r</i>, and the nearest approach
they can make to the pronunciation of <i>Christ</i> is <i>Ki-li-sse-t(ŭ)</i>.
The Japanese, on the other hand, cannot manage
<i>l</i>, and in their mouths accordingly <i>idolatry</i> becomes
<i>idoratry</i>. The native children of Bengal, quick as they
are in other respects, seldom pronounce rightly those
English words which begin with a sibilant and a mute
when a consonant precedes them, <i>ten stamps</i>, for instance,
being made into <i>ten-y-stamps</i>, and <i>this string</i> into <i>this-y-string</i>.
The same sound which is pronounced without
difficulty in certain combinations may be a hopeless
puzzle in others, and the English tourist who mispronounces
<i>Boulogne</i> and <i>Cologne</i>, will yet ask for an <i>onion</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
and talk of a <i>barrier</i>. No individual, it would seem, pronounces
all his sounds exactly like his neighbours, and
even the same individual will vary his pronunciation of
the same word in the course of a few seconds. Variations
of pronunciation, in fact, are like the variations we
observe in plants and animals, and if any variation becomes
marked and is rendered popular and general from some
cause or other, it brings about an alteration in the form of
words. Such alterations resemble new species in natural
history, and we may compare the different species of
pigeons or dogs with the differences of pronunciations
given by different dialects to what was originally the
same sound. Changes in the pronunciation of words are
constantly going on, causing a language to alter its form
and appearance or to branch out into dialects. As these
changes are determined by circumstances and physical
necessities, and not by the arbitrary will of the individual,
the laws they follow can be discovered and laid down.
The laws once known, we can tell what words and sounds
in different dialects, or in the different periods of the same
dialect, may be compared together and referred to a
common source, supposing, that is, that the significations
they bear allow us to ascribe the identity of their phonetic
elements to anything more than coincidence. The
laws of phonology enable us to assert that the Greek
καλός, and the English <i>hale</i> or <i>(w)hole</i>, may be traced back
to a common origin so far as their outward crust and
garment—the phonetic sounds of which they are composed—is
concerned; it then remains for sematology to
decide whether the ideas of “beauty” and “soundness”
can be connected together. Distinctions between sounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
must be studied in spoken languages, and we must not
forget that it is always very difficult to discover what was
the <i>exact</i> sound attached to a word no longer spoken, but
preserved only in the custody of writing.</p>

<p>Different tribes and races vary much as to the sounds
which they find it easy or hard to pronounce and imitate.
A sound which has been changed into a certain other
sound in one language, may have been preserved or
changed into quite a different sound in another language.
In our Aryan group the palatals were originally gutturals;
in Malayan, on the contrary, dentals. Because
our Teutonic forefathers turned <i>k</i> into <i>h</i>, we must not
conclude that such a change was possible all over the
world, and that wherever we come across an <i>h</i> we are at
liberty to assume an earlier <i>k</i>. Indeed, there is clear
evidence that in some languages <i>h</i> may become <i>k</i>. The
phonetic laws which hold good of one group of languages,
or of one member of a group, do not necessarily
hold good of another.</p>

<p>In comparing languages we have first to compare their
grammars, not their vocabularies. The reason of this is
obvious. It is in the sentence, not in the isolated word,
that languages agree or differ, and grammar deals with
the relations that the several parts of the sentence bear
to one another. Single words may accidentally resemble
each other in both sound and sense, and yet belong to
languages which have nothing in common. In the
Quichua, or dialect of the Incas, three words—<i>inti</i>,
“sun;” <i>munay</i>, “love;” and <i>veypul</i>, “great”—resemble
the Sanskrit <i>indra</i>, <i>manyu</i>, and <i>vipula</i>,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> but this is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
only likeness that can be detected between the two
tongues. So, too, the Mandshu <i>shun</i>, “the sun,” coincides
in sound and meaning with the English word, like
the Mandshu <i>sengi</i> and Latin <i>sanguis</i>, “blood,” or the
North American Indian <i>potómac</i> and the Greek πόταμος,
“river.” Such accidental coincidences turn up all the
world over. The number of articulate sounds used in
actual speech is, after all, not so very large, nor also the
number of different ideas needed by primitive man; and
when we bear in mind the probable onomatopœic origin
of the greater part of our vocabulary, it is not wonderful
that these coincidences should occur. Indeed, the wonder
would be if they did not. But a coincidence of this
sort is one of the surest evidences we can have that the
words which seem to resemble one another have no connection
whatsoever. As Professor Max Müller has said,
“sound etymology has nothing to do with sound.” Language
is continually changing; and as the phonetic and
significant changes in it are occasioned by outward conditions
and circumstances which vary from age to age
and from country to country, they must necessarily take
a different direction in the mouths of different speakers.
The very fact that the English <i>call</i> and the Greek καλέω
have almost every letter in common, ought to have raised
a presumption against their identity, even before the law
was known that an English <i>c</i> answers to a Greek γ, and
a Greek κ to an English <i>h</i>, and that, consequently, the
true Greek representative of <i>call</i> is γήρυω, and the true
English representative of καλέω is <i>hail</i>.</p>

<p>But if we are not to compare words of the same sound and
sense together, how, it may be asked, are we to ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
the relationship of two or more languages, and discover
what sounds correspond to each other in them? Our only
guide is grammar. If we find that two languages express
the relations of grammar in the same way, and by the help
of the same machinery, we may conclude that the two
languages come from a common source, and, therefore,
possess a common stock of words. Under grammar will
also be included structure—that is to say, the order and
position of the parts of the sentence, as well as the conception
of the sentence itself. Grammar and structure,
therefore, are the clue by which comparative philology
must be guided in its researches. It was the neglect of
such a clue that caused Latin and Greek to be compared
with Hebrew, and made the etymological dictionaries of
the last century a rubbish heap of wasted labour. Those
languages only which agree in their way of viewing the
relations of thought can be grouped together. When
once agreement in grammar and structure has determined
the probable connection of two tongues, the aid of
phonology may be called in to complete and verify the
inquiry. Where the grammars are really connected, we
may feel quite certain that there will be a community of
roots. Where, on the contrary, there is no connection
between the grammars, a community of roots must be
due to accident. What proved the existence of an Aryan
family of speech, and thereby founded comparative philology,
was not the resemblances between individual words,
striking as these were, but the exact correspondence between
the grammatical forms of the several members of
the family. The lists of words drawn up by Sir W. Jones,
by Adelung or by Vater, remain mere literary curiosities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
The comparative philology of Aryan speech was
really created by the comparative grammar of Bopp.
When once the grammatical relationship of the Indo-European
languages had been established, there was a
solid basis for phonology to work upon, and it was not
long before Grimm discovered the laws which regulate
their interchanges of sound.</p>

<p>But in comparing grammar and structure, we must be
careful to exclude the accidental, or rather the phænomena
due to the peculiar circumstances in which an
individual tongue has been placed. We ought to be able
to trace the history and development of each special
language as far back as possible, ascertaining its oldest
forms and noting the successive changes they have
undergone. For this purpose it is necessary that the
language should be a literary one, and that the various
phases of its growth should have been preserved on
monuments or in books. Where this is not the case, we
have to fall back upon a simple comparison of existing
dialects, and endeavour to restore from these the common
forms to which their variant derivatives seem to
point. The greater the number of dialects the more
satisfactory will be the results of our comparison; accidental
resemblances will be better eliminated, and intermediate
forms are more likely to be preserved. Where
the dialects to be compared are few, we have to contend
against one of two difficulties—either the differences
between them are so slight—as in the case of the Semitic
languages—that the parent-speech from which they
branched off must be too recent to throw any light on its
earlier history and relationships; or else the differences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
are so great, the time during which they have been
separated so considerable, that the links have been lost
by which we may connect them together and reduce
them to a single origin.</p>

<p>Phonology requires a knowledge of the past history
and development of the languages it deals with even
more than the study of grammar. In the comparison of
words we may lay down the general rule that roots and
not derivatives should be compared together. We should
trace the history of the words we examine as far back as
may be, should reduce them to their simplest forms, and
strip off the accretions that have grown round them like
the lichen round the stone. Words derived from the
same radical will often assume different forms in different
languages, or even in the same dialect; while words derived
from different radicals will, on the other hand, assume
the same form in different languages, or even in the
same one. <i>Captive</i> and <i>caitiff</i> have the same origin in
the Latin <i>captivus</i>; <i>sound</i> may be either the Latin <i>sonus</i>
or <i>subundare</i>, or the Anglo-Saxon <i>sund</i>, “hale,” or
<i>sund</i> from <i>swimman</i>. The American <i>potómac</i>, quoted
above, is a compound, while the Greek πόταμος comes from
the root πο-, which we find in πίνω and πότος, in the Sanskrit
<i>pânam</i>, “a drink,” and our own <i>potion</i>. The lexicographers
who have declared <i>monkey</i> to be a corruption of <i>mannikin</i>
were little aware that the word is really the Italian <i>monichio</i>,
the derivative of <i>monna</i>, and that <i>monna</i>, again, is
a contraction of <i>madonna</i>, <i>mea domina</i>. Before we know
the history of a word, we must not venture to compare it
with another, though it may happen that the history will
be learnt through the process of comparison itself. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
we know that the Gothic <i>fimf</i>, “five,” has lost two gutturals,
as well as a final labial, from the analogy of the
Latin <i>quinque</i> (for <i>quinquem</i>), the Sanskrit <i>panchan</i> and
the Lithuanian <i>penki</i>, and we can thus trace it back to
the period when the Aryans of Europe and of Asia were
still undivided. But at this point our materials fail us.
We may feel pretty sure that <i>quemquem</i>, the original
Aryan word for “five,” is a simple root, and that its numerical
meaning is a derived one; we may even hazard
the guess that it has been formed by reduplication, but
beyond this a sound method of etymology cannot go.
To connect it with the Semitic <i>khâmésh</i>, as Ewald has
done, is to violate the rules of comparative philology.
We know the history neither of <i>khâmésh</i> nor of <i>quemquem</i>.</p>

<p>In comparing words together, it is safest to begin with
two classes of words, those which, like the numerals, have
acquired a fixed and arbitrary meaning, and terms of
relationship and every day use. In the case of the
former, the signification, once fixed, remains unaltered,
however much the phonetic crust of the word may change,
while new names are less likely to come into vogue; in
the case of the latter, the very frequency of their use
tends to keep them in existence. If a few families here
and there adopt new modes of expression, still it may be
expected that the larger part of the community will be
more conservative. Hence, when we find two languages
agreeing in their numerals and words expressive of common
objects and ideas, we may infer that they are related
to one another. The pronouns are not so sure a criterion,
as they have generally been worn down by constant use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
to monosyllabic forms, while their antiquity prevents us
from discovering their true history and origin. Like the
names of “father” and “mother,” moreover, the first and
second personal pronouns show a tendency to be represented
in most languages by the simplest and earliest
sounds uttered by the child.</p>

<p>The laws of phonology must be established by as large
a number of instances as possible. In no other way can
the chances of accident or mistake be avoided. A law,
in fact, must hold good of all the phænomena that are
summed up under it, and the more numerous the
phænomena, the wider and more firmly established will
the law be. Grimm’s laws of the interchanges of sound
in the Aryan family of speech depend on the observation
and comparison of a very large number of words. As
soon as it was found that English words which contained
a <i>th</i> answered in signification and general form to Latin
and Greek words which had a <i>t</i> in the same place, it was
possible to formulate the law: English <i>th</i> = Latin and
Greek <i>t</i>; all that remained was to verify the law by
fresh instances, and in this way to strengthen the proof
of the connection of the two languages. If it could be
shown that real exceptions to the law occur which are
not due to the interference of other laws, the law would
have to be given up, however numerous might be the
apparent instances on which it rested. The progress of
comparative philology is continually strengthening its
phonological laws and adding to their number.</p>

<p>The intimate connection of sound and sense must
never be lost sight of in etymological research. They
are as it were the outer and inner sides of the same object.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Where the significations are unrelated, we cannot connect
two words which agree in phonetic sound any more than
we can connect two words of the same signification but
different sound. In our own group of tongues the two
separate roots <i>dhā</i> “to suck,” and <i>dhā</i> “to place,” for
example, are identical in sound; and if we turn to languages
like Chinese or Ancient Egyptian, we shall find
numberless cases in which the same word, so far as pronunciation
is concerned, has a variety of unallied meanings
like our English <i>box</i> or <i>scale</i>. Of course, it is not
necessary that the signification of the words we compare
should be exactly the same; the signification of words
changes as much as their outward phonetic form; but
we must be able to show that one meaning is derived
from the other, or from a common parentage, just as we
show that one sound is derived from another or from a
common source.</p>

<p>For the purposes of phonology more especially, the
study of living spoken dialects is indispensable. No
doubt the historical character of glottology requires us
to investigate the records of extinct languages with as
much care as the facts of living ones, and it is only by
learning what a language once was that we can properly
know what it is now. Nevertheless, it is only in the
modern languages that we can discover the nature and
laws of pronunciation; it is only here, moreover, that we
are brought face to face with the problems and realities
of speech. The biologist, it is true, cannot dispense with
the aid of comparative anatomy, but his primary object
is the study of the living organism. What has been
termed “antiquarian philology” has sometimes stood in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
the way of scientific progress; sounds have been confounded
with letters, and words instead of sentences have
been made the units of speech. Antiquarian philology,
furthermore, still has the shadow of classical scholasticism
hanging over it; it will need a long education before the
world is disabused of the idea that superiority in literature
means superiority in language, and that a scientific
study of language is identical with the old-fashioned
“philology” of the classical scholar. Before the forms
of an extinct speech can be made available for scientific
investigation, they must be revivified by the translation
of their written symbols into phonetic sounds, and how
hard such a task is need not be pointed out. If we wish
to work back to the former pronunciation of a language
we must start from its modern and actual pronunciation,
and in spite of all that we can do, in spite of slow and
patient induction and a careful weighing of the facts, our
conclusions will be at the best imperfect and approximative.
The older and more scanty the remains of a language,
the more defective and uncertain will be our
restoration of its pronunciation. In the larger number
of cases we have to be content with merely approximative
results. What Mr. Ellis and Mr. Sweet have done
for the pronunciation of early English, is due to the
abundance of the data and the unbroken tradition which
they embody; to restore the pronunciation of Latin is a
work of greater difficulty, to restore that of ancient
Greek of greater difficulty still. In short, the records of
dead speech must be interpreted by the facts of living
language, just as the conditions which brought about the
deposition of the rocks can only be explained by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
forces still at work upon the surface of the globe. Here
as elsewhere in science, we must proceed from the known
to the unknown. The laws of consonantal change laid
down for Latin and Greek, for Sanskrit and Zend, for
Keltic and Old High German, receive their verification
and explanation from the Romance dialects of modern
Europe; while it is in the study of savage idioms, in the
languages of Bushmen and of Kafirs, of North American
Indians and of Papuans, that some of the most precious
facts of linguistic science have been obtained. An extinct
literary language, indeed, is by its very nature less
serviceable to the comparative philologist than the artless
jargons of barbarous tribes. It is artificial rather than
natural, and the product of individual idiosyncrasies
rather than of the whole community. The further removed
it is from the fresh current of living speech, the
less capable it becomes of strictly scientific treatment.
The individual element, with all its arbitrary capriciousness,
has entered too largely into it. The grammatical
forms invented and enforced by ignorant grammarians,
the words coined after false analogy by the Homeric
rhapsodists and their successors, or the stilted phrases
and inverted expressions employed by a particular
writer and his imitators, all belong to the domain of the
“philologist” rather than to that of the scientific student
of language. He has nothing to do with textual criticism
or the study of style, much less with the successful reproduction
of the idiosyncrasies of classical authors.</p>

<p>Philology in the narrower sense of the term has to prepare
materials for comparative philology in so far as the
latter is concerned with literary languages or dialects. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
its turn it is guided in its researches and kept within the
limits of scientific accuracy by comparative philology
which tests and rectifies its conclusions, and prevents for
the future attempts like that of Buttmann to derive ἄφνος
from ἄφθονος or that of K. O. Müller to extract πελασγός from
πελαργός. The particular can only be understood in the light
of the universal, and as long as we are dealing with one
language only our comparisons must be limited to that
language alone at different stages of its growth, and will
consequently sometimes lead us astray. Error can only
be avoided by making our field of comparison as wide as
possible, and so bringing our theory to the test of the
greatest possible number of facts. It is evident from
this, however, that the comparative philologist will have
a special and minute acquaintance with but a few out of
the many facts which come before his view. The memory
even of a Mezzofanti is limited, and the ordinary student of
language must be content to derive from others a large
proportion of the materials on which he works. Caution
in the choice and use of his authorities is here absolutely
requisite, and it ought to be the business of the specialists
in each language to see that the facts presented to him are
thoroughly accurate and exact. Their work is the foundation
upon which the structure of comparative philology
has to be built.</p>

<p>But the comparative philologist cannot dispense with
a specialist’s knowledge of at least two languages. In no
other way can he have that intimate acquaintance with
the inner life of speech requisite for his studies, or
possess the necessary instinct for selecting the right authorities
to whom to trust when dealing with tongues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
with which he is unacquainted. The more languages
he knows thus thoroughly the better, especially if these
belong to different classes of speech. Unless the Aryan
scholar is acquainted with a Semitic language, his theory
of flection is likely to be one-sided and faulty, and unless
he have a further knowledge of some agglutinative dialect,
his views on the relation between flection and agglutination
must be received with a certain amount of distrust.
Grammars and dictionaries will not give us that
grasp upon the inner structure and spirit of a dialect
which is all-important in determining some of the chief
problems of speech. They present us only with the external
facts of a language: before we can <i>think</i> in it, before
we can place ourselves in the mental attitude of its
framers and speakers, we must be saturated with it, as it
were, and have that knowledge of it which can only come
from daily and constant use.</p>

<p>At the same time, it must not be forgotten that the
comparative philologist should not introduce the frame
of mind of the specialist into his comparative inquiries.
The specialist who takes up comparative philology
as a subsidiary pursuit is likely to spoil it in the
taking. The minor details of his special subject,
whether it be Greek or Sanskrit or Hebrew, will assume
an unreal importance in his eyes, and the main phænomena
to which his attention ought to be directed will
be correspondingly dwarfed. Bopp was the father of
comparative philology simply because he was not a specialist
in any one of the Aryan languages; had he been
a Sanskritist, and nothing else, he would doubtless have
produced an excellent Sanskrit grammar, but not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
famous text-book of scientific philology. The errors
into which he fell have since been corrected by the
special students of the various languages he handled so
freely: the knowledge he acquired of them was sufficient
for the great purpose he had in view, and an exhaustive
study of any one of them would merely have consumed
the time and energy which were needed for his other
work.</p>

<p>We can now see clearly what is the object and scope
of the science of language. It has to do with language
in all its forms as the significant utterance of society.
Where utterance ceases to be significant, the science of
language also ceases to investigate it. Beyond the
barrier of roots it is unable to pass; other sciences—ethnology,
psychology, physiology—must be called in if
we wish to know what lies beyond that barrier, what, in
short, were the inarticulate utterances and gestures
which gave rise to articulate speech. Glottology has to
investigate the origin of language so far as it is really
language, but no further. By the use of the comparative
method, words, forms, sentences, dialects, and languages
are classified and traced back to their most primitive
form, and the laws which govern their development
and relationships determined and explained. In this
work of comparison, phonology and sematology ought to
go hand in hand, since language consists in the intimate
union of sound and thought; but inasmuch as the facts
and laws of phonology can be more readily discovered
and tested than those of sematology, it is necessary that
our linguistic researches should have their starting-point
on the phonological side. Inasmuch as language is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
reflection of the thought of a community, the history of
words and forms, as determined by the application of the
laws of glottology, will be also the mental and spiritual
history of the community that used them. Like the
geologist, therefore, who can reconstruct the material
history of the earth and restore the various forms of life
that have successively peopled it, the scientific student
of language can read the past history of human society
in the fossil-records of speech. By tracing the Greek
δῆμος to the root δα, “to divide,” he can show that private
property in Attica originated in that allotment of land
by the commune which still prevails among the Slavs,
while not only the existence but even the mode of life
and intellectual horizon of the primitive Aryans has been
revealed by comparative philology with more certainty
and minuteness than could have been done by any
chronicle, however perfect. But perhaps the most important
of the results obtained by the application of the
comparative method to language, has been the light
thrown upon the origin and nature of mythology and
the history of religion. Two new sciences, those of comparative
mythology and comparative religion, have grown
up under the shelter of glottology, and form subordinate
sciences dependent upon it. In the more immediately
practical sphere of education, again, the science of language
has lightened the labours of the learner by explaining
the reason of the rule while it insists upon the
reversal of the old unscientific mode of teaching languages
by beginning with the dead ones, and points out
that the method of science and of nature alike is to
proceed from the known to the unknown. By breaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
down the prejudices that have so long maintained our
present cumbrous and inaccurate spelling, it is preparing
the way for a reform in that direction, with its consequent
saving of time and labour, while the construction of an
universal language is the aim towards which its students
ultimately look.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, though much has been accomplished,
much more still remains to be done. Comparative
philology and the science of language are not yet a
century old, and the problems of speech that still await
solution are many and important. The previous chapter
will have shown how various are the opinions still
held as to the nature of language and its science,
while the belief that the exceptional—we might almost
say abnormal—Aryan family of speech is the type
and rule of all others still unconsciously influences
a large amount of philological reasoning. Is the science
of language a physical or a historical one? Did roots
constitute a spoken language or are they phonetic types
which never entered into actual speech? Have isolating
languages become agglutinative and agglutinative languages
inflectional? Do dialects precede the common
language or does the common language precede dialects?
Have the languages of the world been all derived from one
or two primitive centres or do they point to an infinite diversity
of origin? Such are some of the questions which
still await an answer, and the answer requires more
investigation, more patient observation and induction,
and, above all, more labourers in the field of research.</p>

</div>

<p>Sciences may be classed as historical or physical according
as they deal with the mind of man or with external
nature. The forces and materials of nature remain always
the same: oxygen and hydrogen, for instance, are in no
way different to-day from what they were a million of ages
ago, and, combined in the same proportions, would always
have produced water. Man and his intellectual creations,
on the other hand, have a history; that is, the same
causes do not always act in the same way, nor do the
causes themselves always remain the same. The sum
of the forces set in motion by the human will goes on increasing
in an accelerated ratio: each new generation is
influenced and moulded by the one that preceded it, and
that influence becomes itself a fresh factor in the sum of
the forces and causes at work. In place of the simpler
processes of nature, with their unvarying uniformity of
action, we have an infinitely complicated <i>development</i>,
each stage of which is the immediate growth of the
previous one, and is in turn the origin and germ of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
that are to follow. Unlike the forces and phænomena of
nature, thought is infinitely progressive, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“through the ages one increasing purpose runs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Wherever we have to deal with the products of human
thought, there we have a constant ever-varying evolution,
conditioned, it is true, by the uniform laws of outward
nature, but continually modifying and adapting them. It
is through the conditions thus imposed on the development
of thought that we can discover the direction it has
taken, and our inquiry thus becomes in great measure a historical
one. We have to see under what conditions, in what
external shape, as it were, the development of thought has
displayed itself at each particular stage of its progress.</p>

<p>Like sociology, or comparative law, the science of language
is concerned with a product of the human intelligence,
and must consequently be included among the
historical sciences. Language, we have seen, is significant
sound; sound without significance is not yet language.
As it is the inward sense and meaning, therefore,
which constitute the essence of language, the primary
object of comparative philology ought to be to
discover the nature, origin, and history of the signification
we breathe into our words and sentences. This can
only be done, however, by finding out the conditions
under which this signification is put into them, and by
questioning the external side of language, those articulate
sounds, namely, whereby we communicate our meaning
to another. Now the external side of language is purely
physiological and governed accordingly by purely physical
laws. Phonology, in short, is as much a physical
science as sematology is a historical one; and if we claim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
for the science of language in general the rank of a historical
science, it is only because the meaning, rather
than the sound, is the essence of speech, and phonology
the handmaid and instrument rather than the equivalent
of glottology. The method pursued by the science of
language is the method of physical science; and this, combined
with the fact that the laws of sound are also physical—the
same conditions producing the same sounds in
all periods of human history,—has occasioned the belief
that the science of language is a physical science. But
such a view results in identifying phonology and glottology,
in making a subordinate science equivalent to the
higher one, and in ignoring all those questions as to the
nature and origin of language which are of supreme importance
to the philosophy of speech. If we treat glottology
as a physical science we must content ourselves
with an exposition of the laws of sound and a mere description
of the languages of the world and their classification,
so far as it is founded on phonology alone. It is
evident that such a classification must be superficial and
incomplete; the relationship of languages is primarily
based on grammar and structure rather than on a community
of roots, and even roots must agree in sense as
well as in sound before they can be admitted in proof of
linguistic kinship. The intimate and inseparable connection
between the inward and the outward, between
sense and sound, in articulate speech, is a symbol of the
connection between the historical and the physical methods
of investigating it; but inasmuch as the sense is
more important than the sound, so, too, the historical
side of linguistic science is more important than its
physical side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>Language and languages are in a constant state of
change: nowhere, indeed, can the maxim of Herakleitus,
πάντα ῥεῖ, be better illustrated. This perpetual flux and
change is necessitated by the very fact that language is a
product and creation of the human mind. Thought is
ever shifting, moving, developing, and so, too, is the
language in which it seeks to embody itself. But language
is not only changing on this its inner side, it
changes also on its outward, its phonetic side. The physiological
organs of speech may be affected by an alteration
in climate, food, or other physical conditions: they
are certain to be affected by the psychological desire to
save trouble or to add emphasis in speaking.</p>

<p>The three great causes of change in language may be
briefly described as (1) imitation or analogy, (2) a wish to
be clear and emphatic, and (3) laziness. Indeed, if we
choose to go deep enough we might reduce all three
causes to the general one of laziness, since it is easier to
imitate than to say something new, while clearness in
expression not only saves our neighbour trouble, but also
preserves us from unnecessary repetition. Nothing is
gained, however, by too wide a generalization; and it is,
therefore, better to keep the three causes of linguistic
change distinct and separate.</p>

<p>Imitation has played a far more important part in the
history of speech than is ordinarily admitted. Imitation
is the primary instinct of the infant and the savage, and,
under the name of fashion, is a ruling power among
civilized men. The great imitative powers of barbarous
tribes have often been remarked upon by travellers; and
a marvellous facility in mimicry and imitation seems to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
exist in proportion to the scanty development of the
reasoning faculties. In this respect, at all events, the
savage has not much ground for boasting of his superiority
to the ape. Among the less cultivated races, indeed,
the passion for imitation frequently passes into a
morbid mania, and strange stories are related concerning
it. Thus Dr. R. Maak, in his “Journey to the Amur,”
states that “it is not unusual for the Maniagri to suffer
from a nervous malady of the most peculiar kind, with
which we had already been made acquainted by the descriptions
of several travellers.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> This malady is met with,
for the most part, amongst the wild people of Siberia, as
well as amongst the Russians settled there. In the district
of the Yakutes, where this affliction very frequently
occurs, those affected by it, both Russians and Yakutes,
are known by the name of <i>Emiura</i>; but here the same
malady is called by the Maniagri <i>Olon</i>, and by the Argurian
Cossacks <i>Olgandschi</i>. The attacks of the malady
which I am now mentioning consist in this, that a man
suffering from it will, if under the influence of terror or consternation,
unconsciously, and often without the slightest
sense of shame, imitate everything that passes before
him.” So, too, Mr. Jagor, in his “Travels in the Philippines,”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
tells us that the malady in question is well
known in those islands under the name of <i>Mali-mali</i>,
and in Java under that of <i>Sakit-latar</i>; and goes on to
relate how his “companions availed themselves of the
diseased condition of a poor old woman who met us in
the highway, to practise some rough jokes upon her.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
The old woman imitated every motion as if impelled by
an irresistible impulse, and expressed at the same time
the most extreme indignation against those who abused
her infirmity.” The description reminds us of the feats
of our own “electro-biologists.”</p>

<p>It is to the desire of imitation that we owe our first
knowledge of our mother-tongue. The child tries to
imitate those about him, and as the faculties of imitation
and memory are the only ones yet developed in him his
efforts are usually successful. The distance at which we
stand from the infantile state, and the development of
our reasoning powers, are measured by the prominence
given to individuality and our power of taking the initiative.
The community in which each man acts like his
neighbour is not yet a civilized community; Athens is
typical of all that is highest in human culture, and Athens
was emphatically the State in which individuality had the
freest play. It is well for the child who has to learn the
language of his parents that he is rather a member of an
uncivilized community than of Periklean Athens.</p>

<p>The love of imitation is the instrument whereby one
language is able to influence another. Sometimes we
find a community giving up its own tongue altogether
and adopting that of his neighbours. Such has been the
case with the Kelts of Cornwall, with the Wends of Prussia,
or with the Huns of Bulgaria. The Negroes of Haiti
speak French, the Lapps Finnish, while according to
Humboldt and Bonpland,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> “a million of the aborigines of
America have exchanged their native for a European
language.” Social contact and not identity of race occasions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
a similarity of language, since language is the
medium of communication between the members of the
same community, not between the scattered branches of
the same race. No doubt where the languages are essentially
distinct, based on radically different conceptions of
the sentence and its parts, even the desire of imitation
will be often not strong enough to cause the one language
to be borrowed by the speakers of the other. Here and
there we come across children who have a difficulty in
imitating the pronunciation or use of the words they hear,
and such a difficulty is a main cause of the origination of
dialects; but it is among the speakers of agglutinative or
polysynthetic tongues when brought into contact with an
inflectional language that the difficulty is best exemplified.
The Negro of the United States still speaks a jargon
which can be called English only by courtesy, and Humboldt
states<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> that “nothing can exceed the difficulty experienced
by the (South American) Indians in learning
Spanish,” although they “manifest quickness of intellect”
in other respects, and “the missionaries assert that their
embarrassment is neither the effect of timidity nor of
natural stupidity, but that it arises from the impediments
they meet with in the structure of a language so different
from their native tongue.” Potent as imitation is, it yet
has a limit, and this limit is reached wherever the element
of conscious intelligence intervenes. The savage, like the
child, finds it hard to mimic the products of civilized
man, in so far as these embody the application of the
reasoning faculties, and the mode of thought elaborated
through long ages by a cultivated race necessarily forms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
a stumbling-block to the Negro or the South American
Chayma. The Ethics of Aristotle could not have been
written in a Semitic language, and a Negro Goethe is a
somewhat incongruous conception. Wherever the distance
between the two languages or the two levels of culture
is great enough, the attempt to imitate is either given
up altogether or else becomes a failure. The modes of
thought of the borrower are read into the language he
borrows. The Chinaman endeavoured to assimilate
English, and the result was the Pigeon-English of Canton,
a jargon in which we have a framework of English reared
upon Chinese grammar and Chinese pronunciation. The
difficulty of reproducing a cultivated language of foreign
origin, or a language based upon a wholly alien conception
of things and their relations, may be illustrated by
the difficulty of translating accurately books written in
another tongue. However closely related two languages
may be, the various shades of meaning they attach to
corresponding words or idioms will necessarily differ, and
the more cultivated the style of a writer, the more impossible
will it be to represent it exactly in a translation.</p>

<p>Where a language is not borrowed bodily, or at any
rate engrafted upon the old modes of thinking and expression,
it may yet exercise a greater or less influence
upon a neighbouring language. Words, sounds, idioms,
suffixes, and even grammatical forms may be and constantly
are borrowed from one dialect by another; and
it is not too much to say that a thoroughly pure and
unmixed language does not exist among the civilized
races of mankind. Our own English is a superstructure
of Norman-French and Latin upon a foundation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
Anglo-Saxon, and nine-tenths of the Hindi language is
Sanskrit. No people can have neighbours close to them
without receiving something from them in the shape of
inventions, products, or social institutions; and these
almost inevitably are adopted under foreign names.
Thus the French have taken <i>meeting</i> and <i>comfortable</i>
from us, and we have received <i>naïve</i> and <i>éclat</i> in return
from them. Such loan-words are of great use in tracing
the history and distribution of civilization, as well as the
geographical and social relationships of the past. <i>Boomerang</i>
proves our intercourse with the natives of Australia,
from whom we have derived both the idea and
the name of the weapon; <i>pew</i>, the Dutch <i>puyde</i>, <i>puye</i>,
“a pulpit” or “reading-desk,” from the Latin <i>podium</i>,
reveals the close connection that existed between the
Churches of England and Holland in the seventeenth
century, while words like <i>maize</i>, <i>hammock</i>, <i>canoe</i>, and
<i>tobacco</i>, derived as they are from Haytian through the
medium of Spanish, show as plainly as ordinary history
that the Spaniards must have been the discoverers of
America and the introducers of its products into the
West. By similar reasoning we infer that the Baltic
provinces must have been inhabited by a Teutonic population
at the time when the Romans received amber from
them under the name of <i>glæsum</i> (our <i>glass</i>), and Professor
Thomsen has proved that the Finns must have bordered
on Scandinavians and Teutons some two thousand or
more years ago from the number of words borrowed by
Finnish from their languages.</p>

<p>Sounds, again, may be borrowed from one language by
another, or native sounds modified through the influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
of a foreign tongue. The easier of the Hottentot clicks
have been borrowed by the Kafirs, and the Souletin dialect
of Basque has admitted the French vowel <i>u</i>. Idioms,
too, may pass readily from one tongue to another. Words
like <i>avenir</i> and <i>contrée</i> in French, are the result of an
attempt to express German idioms in the Romance of the
conquered provincials, <i>avenir</i> or <i>ad venire</i> being a literal
translation of the German <i>zu-kunft</i>, and <i>contrée</i> for <i>contrata
(terra)</i>, a curious representative of the German
<i>gegend</i>, “country,” as derived from <i>gegen</i>, “against.”
The great extension of the English plural in -<i>s</i>, confined
as it was in Anglo-Saxon to a comparatively few words,
seems due to Norman-French influence, and the use of
the genitive and dative of the personal pronouns in English
“of me,” “to me,” in the place of the Anglo-Saxon
<i>min</i> and <i>me</i>, is modelled after a French pattern. Bulgarian
and Roumanian seem to have caught the infection of
Albanian usage in which the definite article is attached
to the end of the word, as in the Roumanian <i>domnu-l</i>,
“the lord,” and Persian has even adopted the Semitic
order of words so repugnant to the general structure of
the Aryan group, in saying <i>dăst-ĭ-’Umăr</i>, for “Omar’s
hand.” For instances of borrowed suffixes, we have only
to point to our English -<i>ize</i> and -<i>ist</i> from the Greek
-ιζ-ω and -ιστ-ης, which tend to supersede the old corresponding
suffixes of the language, and the French participial
termination is imitated in the letter of Gawin Douglas to
Richard II. (1385), where we find such phrases as “Zour
honourable lettres conten<i>and</i>,” and “brek<i>and</i> the trewis.”</p>

<p>The borrowing of grammatical forms is of much rarer
occurrence, inasmuch as grammar is the essence and life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
blood of language, and to borrow the forms of grammar,
therefore, is to intermingle the psychological histories of
two separate tongues. It is a metamorphosis of the whole
inherited mode of thinking and of viewing the relations
of things to ourselves and one another, and to mix two
grammars together is like mixing two different and incompatible
modes of thought. A supposed instance of
a mixed grammar (that is, of a mixed language) generally
turns out to have another explanation. Thus it has
been believed that the modern Aryan languages of India
have substituted agglutinated postfixes for flection, and
so have adopted the grammatical machinery of their
Dravidian neighbours. Thus in Gujerati, <i>dêv-mā̃</i> means
“in the god,” like the Hindustani <i>ãdhe-mē̃</i>, “in the
blind,” and in Nepalese <i>mânis-visê</i> is “in man,” <i>mā̃</i> or <i>mē̃</i>
being a contraction of the Sanskrit <i>madhyê</i> (= <i>madhya-i</i>),
“in the middle,” and <i>visê</i> of <i>visayê</i>, “in the thing.”
What has really happened in these cases, however, is this.
The first noun instead of being provided with the locative
suffix (-<i>i</i>) is compounded with another noun which
still retains the suffix, and the locative signification
accordingly resides not in the second member of the
compound, but in its worn-away flection. Here, then,
there is no example of grammatical confusion. There
are other instances of “mixed grammar,” however, which
cannot be so easily disposed of, and it would really
seem that in rare cases there actually has been an interchange
of grammatical forms between two unallied languages.
Thus in Assamese, which appears to be at bottom
an Aryan language, the plural affix (<i>bilak</i>) is inserted
between the noun and the case-ending, so that from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
<i>manuh-bilak</i>, “men,” we get the genitive <i>manuh-bilak-or</i>,
the dative <i>manuh-bilak-oloi</i>, the accusative <i>manuh-bilak-ok</i>,
the locative <i>manuh-bilak-ot</i>, and the ablative <i>manuh-bilak-e</i>,
where the postpositions are all of them said to be
of non-Aryan origin. The language of Harar, in Northern
Africa, again, though apparently belonging to the Semitic
family of speech, makes use of postpositions, and reverses
the Semitic order of words when employing the genitive;
while, according to Schott, the Persian affix of the dative
and accusative was originally a Turanian postposition.
Cases like these must, of course, be carefully distinguished
from those in which we are dealing with an artificial
language and not with the spoken language of the people.
A curious language of this kind, the Pehlevi, was formed
in the courts of the Sassanian princes of Persia, in which
the elements of Aryan and Semitic grammar were mixed
together in a strange fashion, but such a language did
not penetrate beyond the limits of the learned class.
Of the same nature are such affected plurals as <i>termini</i>
and <i>fungi</i> from <i>terminus</i> and <i>fungus</i> in English, or the
genitive and dative <i>Christi</i> and <i>Christo</i> in theological
German. They would not be understood beyond the
boundaries of a narrow circle.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The most usual way in which the grammar of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
language is influenced by that of another is by the
adaptation of existing words and forms to express new
grammatical ideas and relations imported from abroad.
Thus the Assyrians became familiarized with the distinction
between present and past time through their
acquaintance with the extinct Accadian of ancient
Chaldea, and they accordingly set apart certain separate
phonetic forms, which had previously existed side by
side without any difference of meaning, to express the
present and the past tense.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> So Spiegel<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> believes that
he has discovered the influence of Semitic grammar in
the Zend use of the feminine to denote a neuter or
abstract, and of the dual to denote a pair. The invariable
rule of the ancient Maya of placing the adjective after
its substantive, is sometimes violated in the modern
language through the influence of Castilian,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and the
Ragusan custom of using the Illyrian <i>svoj</i>, “his own,” in
the place of <i>njegòv</i>, “his,” is referred by Brugman to the
influence of Italian and German.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>But the principle of imitation comes chiefly into play
in the sphere of language in changing the form and meaning
of words so as to bring them into agreement with the
form and meaning of other words. When the true history
and significance of certain forms have been forgotten by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
those who use them, other words with a totally different
history and significance are very likely to be assimilated
to them. When language has once created a particular
mould it is very liable to run all manner of words into it.
This is what is meant by the action of <i>false analogy</i> in
speech. Words, forms, and significations which ought to
have been kept apart are erroneously made like one
another; the instinct of imitation and the desire to save
trouble combine to exclude the irregular from language,
and to force all exceptions under a uniform rule. The
modern Greek declines innumerable words which formerly
belonged to different declensions after the type of
ταμίας, turning βασιλέας, ἄνδρας, and the like, into nominatives
singular, and in the English which is unchecked
by a literary tradition <i>I comed</i> is already more common
than <i>I came</i>. Analogy is constantly at work throughout
the whole domain of language—in pronunciation,
in formal grammar, in syntax, and in sematology—building
up and reconstructing what phonetic decay and
change of meaning have tended to pull down. English is
rapidly forcing all exceptional cases under the rule that
throws the accent back as much as possible; <i>balcóny</i> has
become <i>bálcony</i>, and Milton’s line “O argument blasphémous,
false and proud,” would no longer scan. There is
good reason to believe that the vocabulary of the primitive
Aryan was for the most part, if not entirely, accented
on the last syllable; the course of centuries has been continually
thrusting the accent back as much as possible,
and Latin and the Æolic dialects of Greece which illustrate
this tendency, only show their want of conservatism
and relative decay. Though the old accent of pitch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
has become an accent of stress in most of the modern
European tongues, the same process is still going on;
and while Polish still accents its words on the penultima,
the accentuation of Bohemian is upon the first syllable.
The same fact reappears in the Semitic family of speech,
where it can be shown that the penultima primarily
received the accent, and that the accentuation of the
modern Arabic which agrees with that of English is a
later innovation.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Greek words like φῡ́ω, θῡ́ω, and τῑ́ω, where
the length of the vowel compensated for the loss of an
iota (*φυίω), were brought under the general rule of the
language which made one vowel before another short,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
and when Horace addresses the fountain of Bandusia as
“splendidior <i>vĭtro</i>,” the quantity assigned to <i>vĭtro</i>, a contracted
form of <i>vistrum</i> for <i>vid-trum</i> (from the root <i>vid</i>,
“to see”), arises from the mistaken notion that because
a naturally short vowel could be lengthened before a
mute followed by a liquid every vowel in such a position
might be treated as indifferently long or short. So, again,
the termination of the Latin nominative plural in -<i>es</i> was
properly short, as may be seen from a comparison with
the Greek; but the long vowel resulting from the combination
of this termination with the final vowel of stems
in -<i>i</i> (such as <i>nubi-es</i>) was extended to other cases, and
the nominative plural of consonantal stems like <i>voc</i> (<i>vox</i>)
was accordingly regarded as ending in a long syllable.</p>

<p>Apart from accent or quantity, however, the pronunciation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
of words is largely affected by the influence of
analogy. Our English preference for diphthongal sounds
is changing <i>either</i> and <i>neither</i> into <i>aither</i> and <i>naither</i>, in
spite of the fact that the only other word in the language
by which such a pronunciation could be supported is the
misspelt <i>height</i> from <i>high</i>. The Frenchman “gallicizes”
the words he borrows or the proper names he uses just
as the Englishman “anglicizes” his; it is easier for the
one to say <i>Londres</i> and <i>Biarri’</i> than <i>London</i> and <i>Biarritz</i>,
and for the other <i>Paris</i> and <i>Marsaels</i> than <i>Pari’</i> and <i>Marseies</i>.
Up to the last Charles James Fox called Bordeaux
wine “Bordox,” maintaining that it had been domesticated
in England, and ought accordingly to follow
English customs. The action of analogy throws much
light on Grimm’s laws respecting the shifting of sounds
in the various branches of the Aryan family, which will
be specially treated in the next chapter. When once a
particular variety of pronunciation has come into vogue
it absorbs and kills all deviating modes of pronunciation
as surely as the cardoon in Central America has killed the
native plants in its neighbourhood. We are all creatures
of fashion, and the instinct of imitation is at work from
the moment we first cease to be <i>infants</i>,—“speechless”
embryos of humanity.</p>

<p>In the matter of grammar, a familiar instance of the
way in which analogy can change the current forms of
speech is afforded by the extension of the English perfect
in -<i>ed</i>, the last relic of the affixed <i>dide</i>, the reduplicated
past tense of <i>do</i>. The Latin <i>amamini</i> is the plural masculine
of the old middle participle which we find in the
Sansk. <i>bharamâṇas</i>, the Greek τυπτόμενοι, and the Latin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
<i>alumnus</i> (<i>alomenus</i> from <i>al-o</i>) or <i>Vertumnus</i>, the “changing”
year. But when it had firmly established itself as a
substitute for the second person plural of the present of
the middle-passive voice, with <i>estis</i> understood, its true
origin and meaning came to be forgotten, and as <i>amamini</i>
was conjugated with <i>amamur</i> and <i>amantur</i>, so the anomalous
<i>amemini</i> was conjugated with <i>amemur</i> and <i>amentur</i>,
and <i>amabamini</i> with <i>amabamur</i> and <i>amabantur</i>. The
coexistence of the older and later forms of the third personal
pronoun in Greek, σφέ (Sansk. <i>swa</i>, Lat. <i>se</i>), and ἕ
caused the one to be employed as a plural and the other as
a singular, although the pronoun was originally reflective
and of all genders; and the new plural pronoun was then
provided with cases as well as with a dual formed on the
analogy of those of the first and second pronouns. In the
case of the dative alone a difficulty occurred, since here
ἡμῖν or ὑμῖν could not be distinguished in form from σφί(ν)
still used as singular by Herodotus; but the difficulty
was overcome by having recourse to the noun-declension
and creating a σφίσι as a parallel to ναῦσι. The contracted
plural accusative πόλεις could not be derived from the
original πολιας (for πολιανς) by any known rule of Greek
phonology; it owes its existence to the habit of making
the accusative plural like the nominative. The whole of
the so-called fifth declension in Latin has grown up from
the unconscious blunders of speech. <i>A</i> before <i>m</i> tended
to become <i>e</i>, as in <i>siem</i> for <i>siam</i>, and accordingly by the
side of <i>materiam</i> was heard <i>materiem</i>. The accusative
<i>materiem</i> was then confounded with accusatives like
<i>nubem</i>, and so a new nominative came into being, <i>materies</i>
by the side of <i>materia</i>. Meanwhile the vowel of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
accusative case-ending had influenced the vowel of the
other case-endings, and changed the old ablative <i>materiâ</i>
and genitive <i>materiai</i> into <i>materie</i> and <i>materiei</i>. The
same process was next extended to the plural, <i>materiarum</i>,
<i>materiabus</i>, and <i>materias</i> became <i>materierum</i>, <i>materiebus</i>,
and <i>materies</i>, and nothing remained but to assimilate
nominative and accusative as in nouns of the third
declension whose accusative plural also terminated in -<i>es</i>.</p>

<p>Analogy will sometimes alter the whole structural
complexion of a language. The Coptic, formerly an
affix-language like Old Egyptian or the Semitic tongues,
has become a prefix-language, denoting by prefixes the
relations of grammar; and this metamorphosis seems
due to the influence of the neighbouring Berber and
cognate dialects. The tendency must have first shown
itself in a few instances, and then by degrees have extended
to the whole language. It has been held that the Aryan
conjugation with a vowel between the root and the suffix,
as in the Sanskrit <i>bhav-â-mi</i> or the Latin <i>(e)s-u-m</i>, has
grown up in the same manner, verbs like the Sanskrit
<i>ad-mi</i>, “I eat,” alone surviving as the remains of a past
in which the personal pronoun was attached immediately
to the verbal root. This, however, is very doubtful, the
latter class of verbs being more probably the result of
phonetic decay which has obliterated the connecting vowel,
or more correctly the final syllable of the stem.</p>

<p>Syntax has not escaped the all-prevailing action of
analogy and imitation. The relics of English flection are
rapidly disappearing under its influence, and the use of
the conjunctive <i>were</i> will soon be as obsolete as that of
<i>be</i>. The relative pronoun was originally a demonstrative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
like our <i>that</i>, which drew attention to the idea contained
in the principal clause, but with the extension of its use
as a relative its demonstrative signification was lost, and
it came to be used in instances where the demonstrative
could not be employed.</p>

<p>Examples of the power of analogy in changing and
extending the meaning of words are almost needless.
The process is going on before our eyes every day. A
new object or a new idea is named from its likeness to
something with which we are familiar. The Kuriaks call
the ox the “Russian elk” (<i>Ruski olehn</i>), just as the
Romans spoke of the elephant as the <i>Luca bos</i>, and we are
all familiar with the significant name of the <i>Sugarloaf</i>
Mountain. There is a long distance from the primary
signification of <i>post</i> as something “placed” or “fixed”
to its signification as the arrival of correspondence, but
every stage of the way can be traced and shown to be
the work of analogy. The post fixed in the ground
became a station, and when such stations were established
for the conveyance of messages, news was said to
travel “by post.” To transfer the name “post” from the
machinery whereby the news was carried to the news
itself was at once obvious and easy. The <i>foot</i> of a mountain
is as much a metaphorical expression as the <i>arm</i>
of the sea or the <i>arm</i> of law, and every metaphorical
expression is an example of analogy. Three-fourths
of our language, indeed, may be said to consist of worn-out
metaphors. In no other way can terms be found
for the spiritual and the abstract. <i>Spirit</i> is itself “the
breath,” the <i>abstract</i> that which is “drawn apart.” Our
knowledge grows by comparing the unknown with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
known, and the record of that increase of knowledge grows
in the same way. Things are named from their qualities,
but those qualities have first been observed elsewhere.
The <i>table</i> like the <i>stable</i> originally meant something that
“stands,” but the idea of standing had been noted long
before the first table was invented. The only abstract
notion the Tasmanians had attained was that of resemblance.
When they wanted to express the conception of
roundness they had to say “like the moon” or some other
round object, and similarly in the case of other abstract
adjectives.</p>

<p>But as in pronunciation and grammar, so too in the
matter of signification the analogy may sometimes be a
wrong one. The men who coined the term “whale-fishery”
were ignorant of the fact that the whale is a mammal, and
that its only resemblance to a fish consists in its living in the
sea. The name of <i>guinea-pig</i>, again, as applied to the small
animal imported from Brazil, is singularly inappropriate.
At other times the process whereby a new idea or object
has been brought into relation with what was already
familiar has been fair and legitimate. Thus the sense of the
French <i>canard</i> as “idle gossip” can be traced back step by
step to the primary meaning of the Low-Latin <i>canardus</i>.
The feminine of <i>canard</i> is <i>cane</i>, and just as <i>cane</i> is the
German <i>kahn</i>, “a skiff,” so <i>canardus</i> properly signified “a
small boat.” Then by the force of analogy the words
came to denote “a duck,” and as the duck was frequently
used to decoy other birds by its cry, <i>canard</i> ended in signifying
a mere decoy, a mere empty cry calculated to
deceive.</p>

<p>Mythology, as we shall see hereafter, is in large measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
based upon the metaphors of speech. The phænomena
of nature were explained by likening them to those human
actions with which primitive man was acquainted, and
when in course of time a higher level of knowledge had
been reached, and the original meaning of the traditional
epithets had been forgotten, they came to be taken
literally and interpreted as referring to beings of a super-human
world. The dawn had been likened to a rosy-fingered
maiden, the sun to a charioteer, and so the myths
of Eôs, the ever-fleeing maiden, and of Phœbus Apollo,
the heavenly charioteer, came into existence. Mythology
is not so much a disease of language as a misunderstanding
of its metaphors and a misconception of the analogical
reasoning of our early forefathers.</p>

<p>Exactly the converse of this are those popular etymologies
whereby words whose meaning is unknown or forgotten
are assimilated to others with which the speakers
are familiar. A gardener has been heard to call <i>asphalt</i>
“ashes-spilt,” and thus render an explanation of the word
to his own mind, and the modern spelling of the German
<i>sündfluth</i> is due to the popular belief that the word, really
a compound of <i>sint</i>, “great,” the Anglo-Saxon <i>sin</i>, “everlasting,”
was invented to denote the deluge of Noah, which
punished the “sins” of mankind. Luther still writes
<i>sindfluth</i> (<i>sindefluth</i>), and in his translation of the Bible
uses it in other passages besides those which relate to
the Noachian flood (<i>e.g.</i>, Ps. 29, 10, and Sirach 39, 22).
Proper names have naturally suffered, especially from the
attempt to give a meaning to them. Burgh de Walter
has become Bridgewater and Widder Fjord, “the Creek
of Wethers,” Waterford. The name of Madrid is explained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
by a popular legend which makes a boy, pursued
by a bear, fly to a tree and cry to his mother “Madre id,
Madre id” (“Mother, he comes”);<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> the Lepontii, we are
told by Pliny,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> received their title from having been the
companions of Hercules who were “left behind” (λιπόντες!);
and the Kirgises were so named from forty maidens, the
mothers of the race, <i>qyrg</i> being “forty” in Turkic and <i>qyz</i>
“a maiden.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Similarly the modern Greeks have changed
the meaningless <i>Athens</i> into Ἀνθῆναι, “the Flowery,” while
Krisa has become Χρυσό, “the Golden.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Where all other
means failed the name was explained by the clumsy device
of turning it into the name of an individual, and so there
arose those eponymous heroes like Hellen and Asshur
from whom tribes and nations were supposed to have
been designated. The same process of etymologizing by
the help of false analogy meets us in literature as well as
in popular speech. The Homeric Poems are full of instances
of the fact. In the Odyssey the old epic epithet
ἐπηέτανος, “long lasting” (from ἐπὶ, ἄει, and τείνω), has come
to be derived from ἔτος, which had lost its initial digamma
(ϝετος, Sanskrit <i>vatsas</i>), and is accordingly employed in the
sense of “lasting all the year,” while the Aorist infinitives
χραισμεῖν and ἰδεῖν were taken to be presents and so provided
with the futures χραισμήσω and ἰδήσω. Our own absurd mode
of spelling presents us with parallel cases. Because
<i>should</i>, the past tense of <i>shall</i>, has an <i>l</i>, <i>could</i>, the past
tense of <i>can</i>, is given one; and <i>further</i>, the comparative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
of <i>forth</i>, has been written and pronounced <i>farther</i> as if
derived from <i>far</i>.</p>

<p>The desire of clearness and emphasis, the second cause
of change in language, is, like analogy, a creative and
constructive power, and is often found at work in company
with analogy. The object of speech is to communicate
our thoughts to one another; where, therefore, our meaning
is not clearly grasped, we begin to pronounce our
words more distinctly than usual and to lay greater stress
upon them. The result of this is a clear enunciation of
all the syllables of a word, and sometimes a phonetic addition
to the word itself. In this way we may explain the
adventitious dental that has attached itself to the end of a
word like <i>sound</i>, Latin <i>sonus</i>, French <i>son</i>, or the aspirate
which is inserted in the wrong place by persons who are
conscious of a difficulty in pronouncing it in the right place.
So, again, in talking to a foreigner we instinctively raise
the voice and repeat our remarks in a louder tone should
he fail to comprehend them. The more readily our
thoughts are understood, the less need there is of our
dwelling upon the sounds which express them. Hence
it is that with the progress of culture and education, and
the consequent advance in quickness of perception, our
words get worn away and slurred over, and a fragment
only of the original word or the original sentence is
often sufficient to convey our meaning. English and
French are prominent examples of this fact, French
cutting off its final consonants, and English softening its
harder letters and avoiding the free play of the lips.
Classical Italian, nurtured on the pedantic and metrical
pronunciation of literary Latin and screened by the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
of Tuscany, cannot, it has been well said, be spoken
rapidly; but if we go to the Bolognese dialect, where these
influences have not been at work, we shall find “A n’
vuoi t’ m’ in parl, S’nor,” doing duty for, “I won’t have
you to speak to me about it, sir.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> While the educated
Frenchman leaves the negative to be supplied by the
mind when using <i>pas</i>, <i>point</i>, or <i>jamais</i> by themselves, the
uneducated Englishman strengthens his negative by repeating
it. Indeed, the repetition of the negative in order
to emphasize the negation is a mark of most early languages,
and runs parallel with the gesture and gesticulation
which characterize the tongues of savages and barbarians.
The muscular effort called forth by the latter
necessarily extends also to the elocution, and a speaker
generally finds that the clearness of his utterances is
assisted by the exercise of the muscles of the arms and
face.</p>

<p>Emphasis acts upon the outward sounds of a word as
well as upon its inner meaning, and like analogy, though
by the contrary process of differentiation, tends to build
up new grammatical forms. The English <i>thunder</i> and
<i>jaundice</i> go back to an Anglo-Saxon <i>thunor</i> and a French
<i>jaunisse</i>, where the intrusive dental must be referred to
the desire of clearness, since it can hardly be said to
facilitate the pronunciation. So, too, in <i>impregnable</i> and
<i>groom</i>, the French <i>imprenable</i> and Anglo-Saxon <i>guman</i>,
we have other instances of the same striving after distinct
and emphatic utterance, and the extension of the
Greek πόλις (Sanskrit <i>puris</i>) into πτόλις, or of πόλεμος into
πτόλεμος must be put down to a similar cause. People who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
wish to be very particular in the pronunciation of their
words are apt to say <i>kyind</i> for <i>kind</i>, and the Italian
<i>luogho</i> has arisen in no other way out of the Latin <i>locus</i>.
The varying quality of a vowel, or an apparent exception
to Grimm’s laws of letter-change may be explained by
this principle of emphasis. Thus the Greek οἶδα, like the
Sanskrit <i>vêda</i> or the Gothic <i>vait</i>, has a diphthong in the
singular, whereas in the dual and plural the vowel is short
(<i>ĭ</i>). This has resulted from the fact that the primitive
Aryan laid the accent on the first syllable of the word in
the singular; the less familiar flections of the dual and
plural, however, were accented, and so preserved the short
vowel of the root from being changed. In the same way
the Old High German perfect <i>laiþ</i> in the singular observes
the rule which makes an Old High German <i>þ</i> answer to
an original <i>d</i>; in the plural, however, where the corresponding
Sanskrit form accents the suffixes and not the
root (as in the singular) the rule is violated and we have
<i>lidum</i>, <i>liduþ</i> and <i>lidun</i>. So, too, by the side of the Old
High German <i>brôþar</i> (<i>bruder</i>), answering to a primitive
<i>bhrâ´tar</i>, we find <i>môdar</i> (<i>muther</i>) and <i>fadar</i> (<i>vater</i>)
answering to a primitive <i>mâtár</i> and <i>pitár</i> (<i>pâtár</i>); while
the accent of the Vedic <i>saptán</i> and the Greek ἑπτά, “seven,”
shows why the Old High German <i>seban</i> and the Gothic
<i>sibun</i> have <i>b</i> instead of the regular <i>f</i>.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Emphasis enriches the vocabulary, first of all by introducing
synonyms, and then by making a distinction of
meaning between them. To set two synonyms side by
side is the best way of giving clearness and intelligibility
to our thoughts. Much of the charm of our authorized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
version of the Bible is due to the attempt of the translators
to bring out the meaning of a Greek or Hebrew
word by using two equivalents, one from a Romanic, the
other from a Teutonic source. There comes a time, however,
when we begin to contrast and differentiate the two
synonyms; and so <i>love</i> comes to include much more than
its New Testament synonym <i>charity</i>, and <i>pastor</i>, the
synonym of <i>shepherd</i>, is confined to ecclesiastical language,
while custom only allows us to say “<i>much</i> obliged,”
and “very grateful.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Of a similar nature is the process whereby two varying
forms of the same word become distinguished in use and
signification. Thus the Latin <i>tepor</i> and <i>tempus</i> both go
back to an earlier <i>tapas</i>, “heat,” but the strengthening of
the first syllable of the one, and the change of <i>s</i> into <i>r</i> in
the other, caused them to break apart and in course of
time to be employed with a totally different meaning.
The difference of sense brought with it a difference of
gender, and thus introduced a grammatical change.
The analogy of other nouns in final -<i>or</i> or -<i>os</i> preserved
the masculine use of <i>tepor</i>, while <i>tempus</i> followed the
gender of neuters like <i>genus</i>. The history of the termination
of the nominative singular of Latin comparatives
has been much the same. This was indifferently -<i>ior</i> or
-<i>ios</i> (-<i>ius</i>), like the Greek -ίων and the Sanskrit -<i>yan</i> from
an earlier -<i>yans</i>, and in Valerius Antias<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> we find <i>prior</i>
still used for the neuter in the phrase “senatus-consultum
prior,” while the title of the fourth book of Cassius Hemina’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Annals was, “Bellum Punicum posterior.” <i>Arbor</i>
and <i>robur</i> were originally identical, and M. Bréal has
shown that this was also the case with <i>cruor</i> and <i>crus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
The two latter words both represent the Sanskrit <i>kravis</i>
and the Greek κρέας in the sense of “bloody flesh” or
“bloody limb,” and their differentiation was aided by the
introduction of a new word, <i>caro</i>, in the sense of “flesh.”
<i>Caro</i> originally meant simply “part” or “portion,” a
sense in which the Umbrian <i>karu</i> is still employed in the
Engubine Tables,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and the Oscan <i>carneis</i> in the Tabula
Bantina. Roots, too, as well as derivatives, may be differentiated
and gradually assume independent meanings.
Thus in Greek, if we follow the usual theory, the old
root <i>ar</i> or <i>ara</i> has been split up into three, ἀρ-, ἐρ-, and
ὀρ-, in accordance with the threefold representation of
the Sanskrit <i>ă</i> in European Aryan. Accordingly by the
side of ἀρόω, the Latin <i>arare</i>, the Gothic <i>arjan</i> (Old
English <i>ear</i>), which appropriated to itself the sense of
“ploughing,” we have also ἐρέσσω (<i>remus</i>) in the sense of
“rowing,” and ὄρ-νυμι (<i>orior</i>) in the sense of “rising” to
one’s work. This differentiation of the three roots, however,
seems to have come about after the separation
of the several members of the Aryan group, as we find
no trace of it in the Asiatic branch of the family, and
it must, therefore, have really taken place in the fully-formed
words of the European tongues.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Greek with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
its delicate sense of vocalic difference shows a special
tendency towards utilizing vowel changes for grammatical
purposes. Thus the reduplicated syllables in
δίδωμι and δέδωκα were originally identical, but in course of
time, while the sound of <i>ĭ</i> was appropriated to the
present tense, the sound of <i>e</i> came to mark the perfect.
In the same way Greek verbs in -αω, -εω, -οω all go back
to the form which we have in the Sanskrit -<i>ayâmi</i>, but
later usage tended to assign a transitive meaning to the
form in -οω, and an intransitive one to that in -εω, while
that in -αω floated between the two. It is probable that the
three Semitic case-endings in <i>u</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>a</i>, which respectively denoted
the nominative, genitive, and accusative, all went
back to a primary indeterminate -<i>a</i>. In the Negro Dinka
language certain plurals are formed by lengthening or
sharpening the vowel of the singular, like <i>rōr</i>, the plural
of <i>ror</i>, “wood,” <i>nim</i>, the plural of <i>nom</i>, “head,” <i>līb</i>, the
plural of <i>lyep</i>, “tongue,” or <i>tut</i>, the plural of <i>tuot</i>, “goose;”
and since we find that a verb becomes passive by
simply lengthening the final <i>i</i> of the formative elements
(as <i>ran a-tšī tšōl</i>, “the man has been called,” by the side
of <i>ran a-tši tšōl</i>, “the man has called”), it is possible that
the vowel change in all these cases is due to differentiation
for the sake of clearness and emphasis. Such at least
has been the origin of the tones which form so marked a
feature in Chinese. Dr. Edkins has shown that the confusion
between words of different signification occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
by the loss of various initial and final letters in pronunciation
was obviated by the substitution of tones, and
the effects of phonetic decay have been thus neutralized
by the action of the contrary principle of emphasis.</p>

<p>One of the modes in which this principle comes into
play is what Professor Max Müller has called Dialectic
Regeneration. The words and grammatical forms which
have become effete in the literary dialect, are often replaced
by others taken up from the fresh fountain of
“provincial” speech. There is nothing any longer to
attract attention in what has become so prosaic an expression
as “the four cardinal points,” striking as the
phrase once was; but when Carlyle goes to the Scotch
and borrows from it the “four airts,” we are at once arrested
by the unusual character of the word, a special
emphasis is laid upon it, and we begin to realize its full
meaning. It is in a period of social revolution, like that
of the Norman Conquest in England, that Dialectic Regeneration
is best seen at work on the literary language.
As soon as the latter loses the support of the educated
classes, it fails to withstand the attack of the less favoured
but more deeply rooted dialects which have surrounded
it, and, as in the case of literary Anglo-Saxon with
its inflections and learned terms, it disappears for ever.
The unwritten languages of savages and barbarians are in a
continual state of flux and change. Old words and expressions
which have ceased to possess the needed amount
of clearness and emphasis have to make way for new
ones. The slang of the schoolboy, or the cant of thieves
and costermongers, exemplifies the same fact. It is not
so much the desire of revolting against the proprieties of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
a civilized society, or of framing a secret jargon which
shall be unintelligible to others, that produces these wild
outgrowths of language; it is rather the feeling that
the conventional terms have become mere symbols, or,
as Hobbes said, the counters of wise men, and that the
ideas which are perceived and felt clearly should be expressed
with equal clearness and force. Man is not
wholly ruled by the wish to save himself trouble and
attain his object with the least effort; the healthy love
of physical exertion for its own sake is also a powerful
motive in human life. It is only with the growth of
civilization and thought that the exertion is transferred
from the muscles to the brain, that words become so
many algebraic signs, and that syntax takes the place of
elocution. It has been often noticed that the tendency
of the modern languages of Europe is towards a monotonous
level of both accent and tone; but it must be remembered
that, as long as poetry exists, there will exist
also a tendency in the opposite direction, as well as a
protest against the reduction of all language into a
mere reflection of the dry light of reason. Laziness will
not explain everything in speech any more than it will in
the ordinary dealings of mankind. As Sievers states:—“We
even now often find it stated in works on the science
of language, that all phonetic change results from a
striving to facilitate the pronunciation and simplify the
articulation; or, in other words, that change of sound
always consists in a weakening of sound and not in a
strengthening of it. We may allow that although many
of the phænomena observable in the history of speech can
be brought under this rule, the general application of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
statement is absolutely false.... The idea of facilitating
the pronunciation, if it is to be any longer maintained,
must be regarded as an essentially relative one. Speaking
generally, we must never forget that the different
degrees of difficulty in uttering various sounds are in
themselves extraordinarily slight, and that real difficulties
in forming them are usually experienced only in the
case of sounds belonging to a foreign language.... In
short, real difficulties in pronunciation are never specially
felt by the members of a community which speaks a
given language, and with them only a further development
of their language is possible.”</p>

<p>This brings us to the third and last cause of
change of language, laziness, or, as it has also been
termed, the principle of least effort. As the results of
laziness show themselves principally in the alterations
undergone by the sounds of speech, this cause of change
is commonly known under the name of Phonetic Decay.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
But the meanings of words as well as the expression of
grammatical relations are as much subject to decay as
the sounds of speech; the outward form of <i>age</i> which can
be traced back to the Low Latin <i>ætaticum</i> and the
classical <i>ætas</i>, has suffered no less from the wear and tear
of time than its inward signification, which goes back to
a root meaning “to go.” Like the present strata of the
earth which are the <i>débris</i> of the earlier rocks, the present
strata of language are the worn-out relics of older formations.
The power of laziness, more especially in the
shape of phonetic decay, is conspicuous in almost every
word we utter; it is the first agent of linguistic change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
that strikes the student, and it has accordingly attracted
more than its due share of attention. The influence of
laziness has been insisted on to the exclusion of the two
other equally important causes of change in speech, and
the growth of grammatical consciousness, the discovery
of new grammatical relations and the development of
fresh mental points of view, have even been ascribed to
its action. No doubt its influence is great and far-reaching,
but we must be on our guard against regarding
laziness as sufficient of itself to explain all the phænomena
of language. Phonology is rather affected by it
than either morphology or sematology. Owing, however,
to the large place assigned to it in works on comparative
philology, it will not be necessary to dwell upon it
here in any great detail. We naturally seek to make ourselves
understood by our neighbours with the least possible
amount of trouble. Muscular and still more mental
fatigue is distasteful to us, and the less we have to exert
our vocal organs and powers of thinking when making
our meaning clear to another, the better satisfied we are
sure to be. Hence it happens that we constantly use
words with a very dim appreciation indeed of their full
and exact significance. We select that part of the meaning
only which for some reason or other has made an
impression upon our minds, and very often this part of the
meaning is merely subsidiary and accidental to the proper
signification of the word. But we are too lazy to realize
that proper signification, and so pass words on to others
the mere shadow and fragment of their former selves. It
may often happen that a sense originally imported into
a word by the context in which it accidentally found itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
becomes appropriated to it to the gradual exclusion of
its real signification. The word <i>silly</i>, for example, which
once meant “blessed,” like its German cousin <i>selig</i>, from
being applied euphemistically to half-witted persons, has
entirely lost its true meaning. A word like <i>impertinent</i>
is still in process of being changed. Its positive <i>pertinent</i>
has hitherto preserved its proper sense, at all events in
literature; but the popular mind has already forgotten
the meaning of the negative, and only a short while ago
a member of Parliament was called to order for describing
a remark as “impertinent.” Here the accidental
application of a word has caused its primary meaning to
fall into neglect. Still more striking is the fate which
has befallen words like <i>transpire</i> and <i>eliminate</i>. The
newspapers speak of events “transpiring” in absolute
disregard of the fact that events can hardly “breathe
through,” while <i>eliminate</i> has been used not in the sense
of removing out of the way but of bringing in.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> It is so
much easier to guess at the meaning of a word from the
context in which it occurs than to trace it back to its
real signification, and so long as our use of it is intelligible
there is little care among ordinary speakers as to
whether that use is correct or not.</p>

<p>In this way general terms come to be restricted to individuals,
while words which denote the particular are
extended to denote the universal. <i>Deer</i>, which, like the
cognate German <i>thier</i> and Latin <i>fera</i>, originally signified
wild animals of all kinds, is now confined to a particular
species; while, on the other hand, the Latin <i>emere</i>,
which properly signified “to take” in general, came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
be restricted to the special meaning of taking when we
“buy.” The older significations of words are continually
decaying and being supplanted by new ones. Those who
use them are too lazy to find out their exact significance.</p>

<p>The principle of laziness is equally active in the province
of grammar. Here, too, the relations formerly
conceived to exist between the several parts of the sentence
may be forgotten altogether or replaced by other
relations. The inflections of the Anglo-Saxon noun
have been almost all lost, and the datives <i>him</i> and <i>whom</i>
have become objective cases. Prepositions have taken
the place of the case-endings, the adjective no longer
“agrees” with its noun, but is now conceived of as a
simple attribute, while all remembrance of the dative
relation has faded out of the expressions “give me a
book,” “send it away.” The subjunctive is fast ceasing
to exist, and the modern Englishman troubles himself
but little about the difference between <i>be</i> and <i>is</i> or between
<i>if I was</i> and <i>if I were</i>.</p>

<p>It is in phonology, however, that the principle of laziness
is most active. As far back as we can follow the
history of language we see the stronger and harder
sounds perpetually changing into weaker and easier
ones; and so uniform and constant is this tendency that
in the absence of counter-indications we are justified in
referring most cases of phonetic change with which we
may meet to the operation of decay. Mr. Douse<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> has
lately made an ingenious but unsuccessful attempt to
assign the phænomena of Grimm’s law to what he terms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
the principle of least effort, by supposing that the different
phonetic systems of the several branches of the
Indo-European family were evolved out of the <i>tenues</i> or
hard consonants, at a time when these branches were still
co-existing dialects of a single language, through the influence
of “Reflex Dissimilation.” Reflex dissimilation
is explained to be a more complicated and somewhat
varying instance of that simple cross compensation which
we see exemplified in the Cockney interchange of <i>v</i> and
<i>w</i>, or the perverse persistency with which the same persons,
who leave out the aspirate where it ought to exist,
insert it where it ought to be omitted. In both cross
compensation and reflex dissimilation, however, we have
a compound action of the two antagonistic principles of
laziness and emphasis.</p>

<p>The age of a language is marked by the extent to
which it has been affected by phonetic decay, and when
we find how large its influence has been upon the Old
Egyptian and the Accadian of Chaldæa, as they appear
in the earliest monuments we possess, we may form some
idea of the length of time that must have elapsed since
those languages were first being moulded and fixed. At
the same time we must not forget that phonetic decay will
act more readily upon some classes of languages than upon
others. Wherever there is no clear consciousness of the
distinction between root and grammatical suffix, as in
our own inflectional family of speech, there we may expect
a greater and more rapid amount of change than in
agglutinative dialects where the relations of grammar are
expressed by independent or semi-independent words.
But even the latter cannot escape the law of gradual decay.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
To pass over the incorporating Basque in which
words like <i>dakarkiotezute</i>, “ye eat it for them,” or <i>detzadan</i>,
“that I should have them,” have to be decomposed into
<i>da</i>, “it” or “him,” <i>ekarri</i>, “to eat,” <i>ki</i>, sign of the dative,
<i>o</i>, “for him,” <i>te</i>, sign of the plural, <i>zute</i>, “ye,” and <i>d</i>, “him,”
<i>ez</i> (<i>izan</i>), “to be” or “have,” <i>za</i>, sign of the plural, <i>ta</i>, “I,”
and <i>n</i>, conjunctive affix, we find Yakute Turkish changing
<i>bin</i> + <i>śän</i> (“I + thou”) into <i>biś</i>, “we,”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> while the
written Japanese <i>taka-si</i> and <i>taka-ki</i>, “high,” are pronounced
<i>takai</i>. Chinese itself is not exempt from the
universal rule. As Dr. Edkins<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and M. de Rosny have
shown, the modern Mandarin dialect has lost numerous
initial and final consonants, and words like <i>yi</i>, “one,” and
<i>ta</i>, “great,” were once <i>tit</i> and <i>dap</i>. Along the southern
bank of the Yang-tsi-kiang and through Chekiang to
Fuh-kien the old initials are still preserved, while in the
northern provinces no less than three finals have been
lost and the tones by which Chinese words of similar
form are distinguished from one another are so many
compensations for the loss of letters. Here again we
have the principle of emphasis endeavouring to repair
the damage wrought by the principle of decay.</p>

<p>A literary dialect is naturally less subject to the inroads
of decay than an unwritten one. The spelling of
words reacts upon their pronunciation and preserves it
from extensive alteration. There is a wide chasm
between that Tuscan Italian which has been preserved
from corruption by the genius of Dante and the modern
dialect of Bologna or Naples. In the age of Cicero the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
<i>cave ne eas</i> of polite society had become <i>cauneas</i> in the
language of the people,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and how artificial was the attempt
of pedants and purists to maintain the older pronunciation,
even to the restoration of the final <i>s</i> which had
already been dropped by Ennius, appeared pretty plainly
as soon as the decline of the Roman empire and the
extinction of the literary class deprived it of support.
Latin at once fell away into the Romance dialects of
modern Europe, just as literary Anglo-Saxon with its
inflections and its learned vocabulary disappeared before
the Norman Conquest. The language of the Assyrian
inscriptions remains almost unaltered throughout the
long period of nearly 2,000 years, during which we can
watch its fortunes; but this language was the stereotyped
one of literature and education, and differed very considerably
from the spoken language of the people. The
late linguistic character of Hebrew, the extent, that is,
to which it has been influenced by phonetic decay as
compared with its sister tongues, is an incontrovertible
proof of the backward literary condition of its speakers.
But even literature and cultivation are unable to preserve
a language altogether from decay and change. The
pronunciation of the educated slowly changes; words
become clipped and shortened in spite of their spelling,
and notwithstanding printers and schoolmasters the
spelling in the end has to follow the pronunciation.
Mr. Alexander Ellis has shown in his “Early English
Pronunciation” how widely our modern pronunciation of
English has departed from that of Shakspeare’s time, and
the spelling of <i>though</i>, <i>through</i>, and <i>enough</i> bears witness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
to a period when they ended in a guttural aspirate.
Our pronunciation is still undergoing change; the vowels
are becoming more and more indistinct and merged in a
common obscure <i>ĕ</i>; while such contractions as <i>I’ll</i>, <i>I’d</i>,
<i>won’t</i>, and <i>can’t</i> can hardly be distinguished from Basque
forms like those mentioned above. The educated Englishman
speaks, as the French say, with his lips closed;
he finds that he can be understood without the trouble
of opening and rounding them, and his vowels are accordingly
formed in the front rather than in the back
part of the mouth. No wonder that he has a difficulty
with the French <i>eu</i>; the effort to pronounce it is
too great a strain upon the unexercised muscles of the
lips, and so the English gentleman who told the waiter
not to let the <i>feu</i> go out in his absence found on his return
that his friend had been strictly watched and guarded as
a dangerous <i>fou</i>.</p>

<p>But though a literature and more especially a widely
extended literary education form the chief obstacle to the
action of phonetic decay, there are other social influences
which operate to the same end. Wherever there is a
fixed and stable society, cut off from close intercourse
with its neighbours and handing down unchanged its
customs and institutions, we are likely to find a more or
less fixed and stable language. For language is the mirror
of the community that uses it, and where the community
alters but little the language will alter but little too. It is
in this way that we must explain the fact that Lithuanian,
though unprotected by a literature and spoken by the
least progressive of the European members of the Aryan
family, is yet the most conservative of all the Western<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
languages of our group, or that the Bedouin of Central
Arabia is said to speak at the present day a more archaic
language than those of Nineveh or Jerusalem 3,000 years
ago. Since the institution of an annual fair among the
Rocky Mountains the idioms of the eastern and western
Eskimaux, who at first were hardly understood by one
another, became more and more assimilated;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and the
stationary character of Icelandic may be ascribed as
much to the isolation of the settled Norse community in
the island as to the existence of a literature. Of course,
the community must be one which has reached a certain
level of culture, and its customs and institutions must
imply organization and recognition of fixed principles.
Where the customs and institutions are founded on mere
unreasoning habit and precedent, we are dealing with a
community of barbarians, and consequently with languages
or dialects in a perpetual state of flux.</p>

<p>The changes wrought by phonetic decay are sometimes
sufficient to alter the whole aspect of a language, and
are at once the foundation and the riddle of etymology.
Who would recognize in the French <i>même</i>, for instance,
any derivative from the Latin pronoun <i>se</i>? And yet <i>même</i>
goes back to the Low Latin <i>semetipsissimum</i> through the
Old Provençal <i>smetessme</i>, the later Provençal <i>medesme</i> and
the Old French <i>meïsme</i>. Words of different origin, like
<i>scale</i> from the Latin <i>scala</i> and the Anglo-Saxon <i>scalu</i>
and <i>scealu</i>, may come to assume the same form; while
words of the same origin, like the French <i>captif</i> and
<i>chétif</i>, from <i>captivus</i>, or <i>noel</i> and <i>natal</i> from <i>natalis</i>, may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
appear under different forms. The processes of assimilation
and swarabhakti, of metathesis and epenthesis, to
be described in the next chapter, are so many forms
under which phonetic decay displays itself. The history
of language is the history of the continual weakening of
uttered sounds and the gradual lessening of the demands
made upon the organs of speech, and attempts like that
to reduce the triliteral roots of the Semitic tongues to
biliteral ones are contrary to the whole tendency of language.
Accent alone is able to hold out against the
assaults of phonetic decay; it is only the accented syllable
that remains unchanged when all around it is perishing,
and, as in the case of <i>age</i> from <i>ætaticum</i> or <i>dine</i>
from <i>desinere</i>, is often all that is left of the primitive
word. It is again the struggle between the principle
of emphasis and the principle of laziness, between conservatism
and revolution. Only when the accent is shifted
to another syllable can phonetic decay gain the victory,
and the shifting of the accent is itself the work of the
principle of decay.</p>

<p>The principle of laziness has much to do with the
creation of dialects. Slight variations of pronunciation
and of the usage of words are as inevitable in language
as variations of species in zoology, and where there is
no correcting standard these variations are perpetuated
and intensified. Helped by the two other causes of linguistic
change, the dialect of a household becomes in
time the dialect of a clan or tribe, and as soon as its
characteristics are sufficiently numerous and distinct,
the dialect is transformed into a language. An isolated
community will by slow degrees form a new language<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
for itself. Just as the history and character of one
society differ from those of another, so too must the
dialect or language differ in which the society finds
expression. Even where the rapid and intimate intercourse
of modern civilization and the safeguard of
a common and widely-studied literature stand in the
way, as in the case of England and America, dialectical
differences and peculiarities will yet spring up.
In savage and barbarous communities the growth of
innumerable dialects is a matter of necessity. The
manifold languages of the Malayan and Polynesian
Archipelago can be traced back to a common source, but
the natives of two neighbouring islands are often unintelligible
to one another; while von der Gabelentz says
of the Melanesians, that “every small island has its
own language or even several languages.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Before the
utter extinction of the Tasmanians, with a population of
no more than fifty persons there were four dialects, each
with a different word for “ear,” “eye,” “head,” and other
equally common objects. The language of a shifting
unorganized community will reflect the condition of
those who speak it, and we are not surprised, therefore,
at Captain Gordon’s assertion that “some” of the
Manipuran dialects “are spoken by no more than thirty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
or forty families, yet (are) so different from the rest as
to be unintelligible to the nearest neighbourhood.”
Humboldt tells us<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> that in South America, together
with a great analogy of physical constitution, “a surprising
variety of languages is observed among nations
of the same origin, and which European travellers scarcely
distinguish by their features.” Greece, with its small
extent of country and still smaller amount of population,
was said a few years back to possess no fewer than
seventy dialects,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and no less than eight principal dialects
besides several subordinate ones exist among the modern
Basques, whose whole population is under 800,000.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Indeed, considering the isolation of the Basques, socially,
politically, and linguistically, as well as the narrow tract
of country into which they have been compressed, it is
remarkable that natives of places not forty miles distant
from one another are yet mutually unintelligible.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
But the natural condition of language is diversity and
change, and it is only under the artificial influences of
civilization and culture that a language becomes uniform
and stationary. As soon as the coercive hand of civilization
is removed it breaks out again into a plentiful
crop of dialects. Of course, the vicissitudes through
which semi-civilized peoples are continually passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
greatly assist the process of change. Conquest and the
mixture consequent upon it, famine, disease, and migration,
are all powerful aids to dialect-making. The women
of a tribe who stay at home, or who have been married
out of another tribe, sometimes possess a language
different from that of the men; thus, the Carib women
in the Antille Isles used a different tongue from that of
their husbands, while the Eskimaux women in Greenland
turn <i>k</i> into <i>ng</i> and <i>t</i> into <i>n</i>.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Even religion and superstition
play their part in the work; the sacred language of
the “medicine-men” in Greenland, for instance, is for the
most part an arbitrary perversion of the significations of
known words; thus <i>tak</i>, “darkness,” is used in the sense of
“the north,” and so gives rise to two new words of this
secret speech, <i>tarsoak</i>, “earth,” and <i>tarsoarmis</i>, “roots.”
The custom of <i>tapu</i> among the Pacific Islanders, according
to which every word which contains a syllable identical
with some part of the name of the reigning chief
has to be dropped or changed, is due to the belief that
all things belonging to a chief are consecrated and inviolable.
Since the reign of Queen Pomare <i>mi</i> has been
substituted for <i>po</i>, “night,” in Tahitian, and Hale tells us
of this language<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> that its “manner of forming new words
seems to be arbitrary. In many cases the substitutes
are made by changing or dropping some letter or letters
of the original word, as <i>hopoi</i> for <i>hepai</i>, ... <i>au</i> for <i>tau</i>,
&amp;c. In other cases the word substituted is one which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
had before a meaning nearly related to that of the term
disused.... In some cases the meaning or origin of the
new word is unknown, and it may be a mere invention,
as <i>ofai</i> for <i>ohatu</i> ‘stone,’ <i>papai</i> for <i>vai</i>, ‘water,’ <i>pohe</i> for
<i>mate</i>, ‘dead.’” Similar to the Polynesian <i>tapu</i> is the
Chinese custom of tabooing the elements of the reigning
emperor’s name, and the <i>ukuhlonipa</i>, which forbids the
Kafir women to pronounce a word containing a sound
like one in the names of their nearest relations. Thus,
“Mr. Leslie states that the wives of Panda’s sons would
never call him (Mr. Leslie) by his Kafir name of u’ Lpondo,
on account of its partial identity with that of the chief,
their father-in-law. In the name of the river Amanzimtoti,
‘Sweet Waters,’ in like manner, <i>mtoti</i> has been
substituted for <i>mnandi</i>, hlonipaed or tabooed on account
of its occurring in the name of Tsaka’s mother Unandi.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The Abipones of South America similarly alter the
names of the friends and relatives of a dead member of
the tribe, and the words which entered into the composition
of his name are dropped out of use.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> For a parallel
superstition we have only to think of the old European
belief in the omen involved in the mere pronunciation of
a word, which caused the Greek to speak of his left hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
as ἀρίστερος, “the better one,” and the Roman to change
Maleventum into Beneventum. The belief in the power
of words, in the <i>vis verbi</i> as the Latin termed it, is even
now not extinct, and the same feeling which altered the
“Cape of Storms” into the “Cape of Good Hope” is
still prevalent among us.</p>

<p>The sacred jargon of the Eskimaux sorcerer, which
finds its analogue in the slang of the schoolboy, is merely
one step lower than the ceremonial dialects which are to
be met with all over the world. The <i>Bhasa Krama</i> or
ceremonial language of Java, for example, like the ceremonial
languages of the larger islands of Polynesia, or the
ceremonial conjugation of the ancient Azteks, hedges in
the upper classes of the community with a veritable <i>tapu</i>.
So, too, the Japanese when addressing a superior has to
speak of himself as <i>gu-sau</i>, “a stupid vegetable,” or
<i>yátsŭ-ko</i> (contracted <i>yákko</i>), “house-boy,” and of another
as <i>nandzi</i>, “famous,” or <i>te-máye-san</i>, “the gentleman at
hand,” while <i>o</i> or <i>on</i>, “great,” is prefixed to all words
which relate to the latter<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and distinctive verbs and verbal
forms employed expressive of courtesy.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The Chinaman
is equally the slave of an artificial politeness; he is himself
“the thief” (<i>ts’ie</i>), “the soft-brained” (<i>’iu</i>), while the
person he addresses is “the honourable” (<i>ling</i>) or “the
noble brother” (<i>ling hiung</i>).<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The Indian <i>bhavan</i>, “present,”
is construed with the third person in order to denote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
the second with ambiguous courtesy, and the same reluctance
to place oneself on a footing of equality by a blunt
“thou” shows itself in the Latin of the Hungarian, who
will say “Dominus dignetur commodare mihi librum,”
meaning the second person.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The ceremonial use of the
pronouns reaches a still greater extreme in German, where
in addition to the various titles with which “His Highly
well-born,” “His most serene,” or “His Transparency”
require to be addressed, the second person singular has
to be represented sometimes by a masculine <i>Er</i> (“he”),
sometimes by a feminine <i>Sie</i> (“she”), sometimes by a
plural <i>Sie</i> (“they”). The latter reminds us of the Hebrew
“pluralis majestatis,” and recalls our own employment of
the plural <i>you</i> for the singular <i>thou</i>. Our usage in this
respect was probably influenced by the French use of
<i>vous</i>, and it is perhaps to the same influence that we may
ascribe the Basque use of <i>Zute</i>, “you,” instead of <i>Zu</i>,
“thou,” which seems of comparatively late introduction.
Two Basque dialects, indeed, the Souletin and the east
Low Navarese, have even developed a ceremonial conjugation,
every person of which, except the second plural,
assumes a special form when a superior is addressed.
Besides the ceremonial conjugation there is also a feminine
one, employed whenever a woman is spoken to. It must
be remembered that the Basque verb is an amalgamation
of the verbal root with the personal pronouns.</p>

<p>The rapid changes undergone by languages in a natural
state can only be appreciated by those who have had experience
of a tribe of wandering savages, or who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
observed the alterations children would make in the language
they learn if left to themselves. According to
Waldeck, a dictionary compiled by Jesuit missionaries
in Central America became useless within ten years;
and Messerschmidt states that the inhabitants of Ostiak
villages, only a mile or two apart, are unintelligible to
one another.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The Hurons, Sagard stated in 1631, spoke
such a variety of dialects that not only was the same
language hardly to be heard in two adjacent villages,
but even in two adjacent houses, and these multitudinous
dialects he further described as changing every day. Mr.
Trumbull, however, points out that Sagard’s account must
be received with caution, since he says that the instability
of language among the French was almost as great as
among the Hurons, and his “very imperfect dictionary
of this unstable language, 200 years or more after it was
compiled, enabled Duponceau to make himself understood
without apparent difficulty by the Wyandots, a
remnant of the last nation of the Hurons.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>But the following account given by Sir C. Lyell in his
“Antiquity of Man,”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> shows that it is not necessary for a
community to be semi-civilized or barbarous in order to
prove how rapidly a non-literary language can be transformed.
“A German colony in Pennsylvania,” he says,
“was cut off from frequent communication with Europe
for about a quarter of a century, during the wars of the
French Revolution, between 1792 and 1815. So marked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
had been the effect even of this brief and imperfect isolation,
that when Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar travelled
among them a few years after the peace, he found the
peasants speaking as they had done in Germany in the
preceding century, and retaining a dialect which at home
had already become obsolete. Even after the renewal of
the German emigration from Europe, when I travelled in
1841, among the same people in the retired valleys of the
Alleghanies, I found the newspapers full of terms half-English
and half-German, and many an Anglo-Saxon
word which had assumed a Teutonic dress, as ‘fencen,’ to
fence, instead of umzäunen; ‘flauer,’ for flour, instead of
mehl, and so on.” Destroy literature and facility of intercommunication,
and the languages of England and
America would soon be as different as those of France
and Italy.</p>

<p>It is civilization which counteracts the natural tendency
to multiply dialects, and which is ever striving to absorb
the manifold dialects that exist into a single tongue.
All the social conditions of civilized life tend to break
down dialects, to assimilate languages, and to create
a common medium of intercourse. A common government,
a common literature, a common history and
a common law, all require a common language. The
Macedonian Empire made Greek the language of the
East, and Rome effectually stamped out the various
idioms of its subjects in the West. It needed an
invasion of barbarism and the overthrow of Roman organization
and culture to restore the period of linguistic
disunion. The Church remained the sole representative
of civilization, and consequently the sole possessor of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
common tongue. In fact, wherever civilization has made
an advance, the action of the great causes of change in
language has received a check. Every conquest over
a horde of barbarians, every attempt to found a settled
government, to establish a code of laws, to systematize a
religion, or to originate a literature, is a step forward in
the direction of linguistic unity. The practical aim of the
science of language is the formation of a universal speech,
and the time may yet come when the dream will be converted
into a reality. The inventions of the present century—the
steamer, the railway, and the telegraph—are bringing
all parts of the world into a closer connection with one
another, and abolishing the barriers created by differences
of speech. Commerce demands a <i>lingua franca</i>, and now
that commerce is world-wide its <i>lingua franca</i> must be
world-wide also.</p>

<p>The language of the chief trading nations must finally
prevail in the struggle for existence, and the prophecy
has already been hazarded that pigeon-English, or a
similar grammarless jargon, will be the future medium of
universal intercourse. However this may be, the endeavour
to revive the perishing languages of Europe, and to
make the limits of speech the limits of nationality, is a
reversal of the lesson of history and a return to primitive
barbarism. It is but the transient reaction against the
Empire of the first Napoleon, based on the false belief
that language and race are convertible terms. But the
endeavour, however flattering to nations without a history,
is doomed to failure. Little by little the weaker languages
and dialects of Europe are disappearing before
the schoolmaster and the railway, and artificial nurture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
can alone protract their lingering existence. Gaelic and
Welsh in our own islands, like Breton in France or
Lithuanian in Germany and Russia, must share the fate
which has already overtaken Cornish and Wendic. The
last Wendic speaker, Frau Gülzsin, died on the Island of
Rügen as long ago as 1404,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> while Lithuanian is now used
by scarcely a million and a half persons, in spite of the
philosopher Immanuel Kant’s plea for it as “a still unmixed
language of an old people, now isolated and confined
within narrow bounds,” which would throw light on
the history of the past.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The tendency of time is to unify
and simplify, and exact science even now has but one
tongue throughout the world. The attempt of Bishop
Wilkins to invent a universal language failed, not because
it was premature, but because such a language, like all
others, must be a spontaneous growth; a better fortune
may await the Pasigraphy of Bachmaier,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> which attempts
to do for the man of literature what the Arabic ciphers
have done for the mathematician, since writing differs
from language in being a conscious human invention.</p>

<p>The history of the extinction of languages is similar to
that of the extinction of dialects. We see the same
process at work in both cases, only on a different scale.
Where several dialects exist together, the one which
belongs to the dominant class will finally prevail over the
others. The “Queen’s English” is really the court dialect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
of Chaucer’s day, which became the dialect of literature
and education, and so has succeeded in degrading its
sister-dialects into illiterate provincialisms, and in many
cases in destroying them altogether. Where the educated
and ruling caste is small, the other dialects will continue
to flourish among the mass of the people, and on the overthrow
of the cultured class will once more assert their
own. But in a democratic age like the present, when books
and newspapers are multiplied by the printing press, and
the whole nation is being leavened by the general spread
of education, the dialect of civilization will sooner or
later swallow up its less favoured sisters. The remarkable
sameness of dialect which prevails among the Arabic-speaking
populations of the East may be largely accounted
for by the democratic spirit of Mahommedanism which
holds all men equal before the supreme Khalif. It is,
therefore, of the highest importance to comparative philology
that the decaying dialects of our own or other countries
should be observed and written down before they
have perished. The history of a language can be traced
only by a comparison of its dialects, which often preserve
words and forms that have become obscure and inexplicable
in the standard dialect itself. Where the allied
dialects have disappeared, the chasm that divides the language
we are studying from those with which it was once
connected may be too wide to be easily spanned. For
in language, as in everything else, dialect passes gradually
and insensibly into dialect, and it is not until we compare
the two extremes in the series that we are made aware
of the accumulated differences which the transitions have
involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>The progress of civilization, then, implies a continuous
diminution of the languages and dialects of the world,
and a corresponding extension of a single tongue. Just
as we have seen that language advances from complexity
to simplicity, so we now see that it advances from multiplicity
to unity. The more barbarous a society is, the
more numerous will be the languages that it speaks. The
further back we go into the past, the greater must be
the linguistic anarchy with which we meet. A language
begins with dialects, and since language is the product
and reflection of the community that uses it, the primæval
languages of the world must have been as infinitely
numerous as the communities that spoke them. We start
with the Babel of confusion, with the houseless savage
who did that which was right in his own eyes. Language,
it is true, first cemented society together, but it
also made each society a body of hostile units. Many
as are the existing languages of the earth, they are but
the selected relics of an infinitely greater number which
have passed away. Here and there we still come across
the last waifs of an otherwise extinct family of speech,
the last survivors of a group of languages and dialects
which has long since been forgotten. The Basque, like
the scattered languages of the Caucasus, seems to have
no connection with any other known speech; sheltered
by the mountain fastnesses of Biscay, it remains to bear
witness to the linguistic character of an extinct world.
So far as appears at present, the mysterious Etruscan
which has left us some 3,000 short inscriptions is another
forlorn waif, without kith or kin in the world of known
tongues. Perhaps, too, the language of the Lykian inscriptions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
which still refuses to be “classified” in spite
of the efforts that have been made to turn it into an
Iranian idiom, is a further example of the same kind. The
boulders that have been left on our hilltops do not tell
us with more certainty of the icebergs and icefloes which
brought them thither, than do these stray languages of
the manifold forms of speech of which they are the scanty
remnants. Our only wonder should be not that there
are any tongues which refuse to be classed with others,
but that there are so few which thus maintain an isolated
existence.</p>

<p>As we shall see hereafter, families of languages are
exceptional in the history of speech. Professor Max
Müller very truly says:<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> “Families of languages are very
peculiar formations; they are, and they must be, the exception,
not the rule, in the growth of language. There
was always the possibility, but there never was, as far as
I can judge, any necessity for human speech leaving its
primitive stage of wild growth and decay.” “If we confine
ourselves to the Asiatic continent, with its important
peninsula of Europe, we find that in the vast desert of
drifting human speech, three, and only three oases have
been formed, in which, before the beginning of all history,
language became permanent and traditional; assumed, in
fact, a new character—a character totally different from the
original character of the floating and constantly varying
speech of human beings.” And these oases, these families of
speech, it is important to remember, are themselves made
up of dialects, only dialects with a common grammar and
a common stock of roots. We may, if we like, construct a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
hypothetical “parent-speech,” from which we may derive
the several dialects and languages which are the only
facts we have to work upon; but we must not forget that
such a parent-speech is purely hypothetical, the product
of reflective analysis and logical deduction. Fick’s
dictionary of the Parent-Aryan is as much the creation
of the comparative philologist’s closet as Schleicher’s
“restoration” of its grammatical forms. Because the
Sanskrit <i>panchan</i> and the Latin <i>quinque</i> can both be
reduced to the same form <i>quemquem</i>, it does not follow
that the latter form was ever actually existent. As far
back as we can go, we still find ourselves in the presence
of allied dialects, never of a single tongue. The east-Aryan
primitive <i>ghard</i>, “heart,” cannot be reduced to
the same form as the west-Aryan <i>kard</i>, with the same
meaning; the two variant forms of the root testify to a
dialectical difference from the outset.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Such, too, is the
evidence of words like those for “daughter,” Greek
θυγάτηρ, but Sanskrit <i>duhitâ</i>, or “door,” Greek θύρα, Sanskrit
<i>dwâram</i> (not <i>dhwâram</i>), while the demonstrative pronouns
appear from the first under two incompatible
forms <i>sa</i>(s) and <i>ta</i>(s). For the sake of convenience we
may assume a parent-speech; we may even go so far
as to picture to ourselves a family of languages like a
family in social life, except that it springs not from two
ancestors but from one; but unless we bear in mind that
these assumptions are like the assumptions of the geometer,
ideal creations, never realized in the actual
world, we shall be betrayed into numberless absurdities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
and false conclusions. It is to them, indeed, that we owe
the belief that the primitive Aryans had but the single
vowel <i>a</i> in their alphabet besides the three tenues <i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i>,
the labials <i>r</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, and the sibilant <i>s</i>. Even Dr. Murray,
with his nine primæval roots <i>ag</i>, <i>bag</i>, <i>dwag</i>, <i>gwag</i>, <i>lag</i>,
<i>mag</i>, <i>nag</i>, <i>rag</i>, and <i>swag</i>, did better than this.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Repulsion and division, then, is the natural condition
of language. The three causes of change are ever actively
at work, and the influence of civilization cannot entirely
destroy their power. But with the advance of culture,
the dividing barriers are broken down, and to borrow a
metaphor from mechanics, the centrifugal is exchanged
for the centripetal force. Dialects make way for languages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
and languages in their turn tend to centralization.
Where thought is of more consequence than the vocal
symbols in which it is expressed, means will be found for
making the symbols uniform and constant. Language
begins with multiplicity and disunion, but its end is
unity. The theory that would derive the idioms of the
world from three or four primæval centres, or even from
a single centre, is contrary to the facts. In the very act
of being formed a language necessarily splits itself into
dialectical variety. The children of to-day resemble those
children of humanity, the first framers of articulate speech,
and the children of a single household, if left to themselves,
would have each his own jargon, his own dialect.
So it was, too, with primitive man. Where circumstances
were favourable the inhabitants of the same locality,
breathing the same air, and enjoying the same food,
would maintain a family likeness in the tongues they
spoke; but elsewhere all the causes of change would have
had free play, and the languages of mankind would have
been as numerous as the songs of birds. With the
growth of society, however, language, the great social
unifier, became more and more fixed and settled; though
dialects continued to branch off, they each occupied a
wider area, belonged to a larger community, and retained
their marks of relationship to one another. When
the first level of civilization had been reached, the history
of language entered upon a new phase. Families of
speech became possible, and the same causes that produced
permanence and stability in the customs and
beliefs of the community produced them also in the
dialects that it used. The first step had been made towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
counteracting the anarchy of primæval speech and
attaining that ideal unity to which language tends. Here
and there the race may have deteriorated; the Hottentots,
for instance, with their developed dialects, may be
the degenerate descendants of more civilized ancestors;
but the movement on the whole has been forward and
not backward. Science with a myriad voices declares
the ascent and not the descent of man. Our civilization,
it is true, like the languages that reflect it, is still imperfect,
is still far from the goal that it has in view. But
we may take heart from what has been achieved, and
perhaps even look forward to the day when there shall
be not only one hope and one faith, but also one language
in which they shall find utterance.</p>

<p>The skeleton of language is formed by those phonetic
utterances into which significancy must be breathed
before they can become living speech. They are the
outward vestment of the thought that lies within, the
material in which the mind of man finds its expression.
Thought, it is true, may be conveyed through gesture
and picture-writing as well as through phonetic utterance,
but in phonetic utterance alone does it find a
vehicle sufficient and worthy of itself. Like the marble
in the hands of the sculptor, however, sound not only
embodies meaning; it also limits and defines the expression
of that meaning, and confines it within barriers
which it may not pass. The language of man is
conditioned by his physical structure and organization.</p>

<p>What anatomy is to physiology, that phonology is to
the science of language. Comparative philology is
based upon phonetic laws; the relation of words, of
forms, of dialects, and of languages is determined by the
laws which govern their outward shape. Languages are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
grouped together because they have a common stock of
roots and a common grammar; and the identity of roots
and of grammar is on the outward side an identity of
phonetic sound. The laws of scientific philology are for
the most part the laws which regulate the change of
sounds, and these are dependent on the physiological
structure of the organs of speech. The priority of sounds,
of words, and even of dialects, is frequently to be discovered
by an appeal to the formation of the throat and
lips. We may lay down the general rule that the harder
sound passes into the easier, rather than the easier into
the harder; but it lies with phonology and physiology
to determine which is really the harder sound. It is
phonology which has created the modern science of language,
and phonology may therefore be forgiven if it
has claimed more than rightfully belongs to it or forgotten
that it is but one side and one branch of the master
science itself.</p>

<p>The empirical laws of the interchange and equivalence
of sounds in a special group of tongues are ascertained
by comparative philology; the explanation of these
laws, the assignment of their causes, the determination
of the order followed by phonetic development or decay,
belong to the province of phonology. Phonology touches
on the one hand upon physics in so far as it is concerned
with the analysis of the sounds of speech, and on the
other upon physiology in so far as it studies the nature
and operations of the vocal organs themselves. It is, in
fact, as much a branch of physiology as it is of the science
of language, dealing as it does with a special department
of physiology; but it passes beyond the province of physiology<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
when it investigates the nature of the sounds
produced by the activity of those organs with which
alone physiology is concerned. But whether it touches
upon physiology or upon physics, phonology is equally
one of the physical sciences, pursuing the same method
and busied with the same material. So long as philological
research is purely phonological, so long have we
to do with a physical science; it is only when we turn
to the other problems of glottology, only when we pass
from the outward vesture of speech to the meaning which
it clothes, that the science of language becomes a historical
one. The inner meaning of speech is the reflection
of the human mind, and the development of the human
mind must be studied historically. Those, therefore, who
refuse to regard glottology as other than a physical
science, take as it were but a half-view of it; they are
forced to confine themselves to its outward texture, to
be content with a mere description of the different
families of speech and their characteristics, like the botanist
or the zoologist, and to leave untouched the
many questions and problems which a broader view of
the science would present to them. It is true that even
upon the broader view, the method of the science is as
much that of the physical sciences as the method of
geology; it is also true that the doctrine of evolution has
introduced what may be termed the historical treatment
even into botany and zoology; but nevertheless linguistic
science as a whole must be included among the historical
ones, unless we are to narrow its province unduly and
identify it with the subordinate science of phonology.
The physical science will give us the skeleton of speech,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the dry bones of the anatomist’s dissecting-room; for life
and thought we must turn to history.</p>

<p>We must not forget, however, that we can understand
the past only by the help of the present. An antiquarian
study of philology will enable us to trace the history of
words and forms, to group languages into families, and
to discover the empirical laws of phonetic change; to
interpret and verify these laws, to correct our classifications
and conclusions, to learn what sounds really are, we
must examine the living idioms of the modern world.
The method of science is to work back from the known
to the unknown, and if we are to study glottology to any
purpose and to extend and confirm its generalizations, it
must be by first observing and experimenting on actual
speech. We must begin by disabusing our minds of the
belief that words consist of letters and not of sounds; on
the contrary, letters are at best but guides to the sounds
they represent, and only the experienced student of actual
sounds is in a position to determine their real value.
Phonology stands at the threshold of linguistic science,
and those alone who have honestly wooed and won her
can enter into the shrine within. The physical science
leads upward to the historical science; the key to the
past is to be found in the present.</p>

<p>Now the first question we have to ask is, What is a
sound? The most general answer we can give to this
question is that a sound is the impression made upon the
organs of hearing by the rapid swinging of an elastic
body in an elastic medium, which is usually the air. The
vibrations set on foot by this rapid swinging reach the
ear under the form of waves, and these may succeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
each other at either irregular or regular intervals. In
the first case we have what is called a noise—a source
of constant delight to the savage and the infant, but exceedingly
painful to the sensitive ear. In the second
case musical tones are produced, among which must be
counted the utterances of articulate speech. Tones, or
rather full tones (as opposed to partial ones), are distinguished
from each other by their (1) strength or loudness,
their (2) height or pitch, and their (3) quality or <i>timbre</i>.
The strength depends upon the amplitude of the vibrations
produced in the elastic medium, the pitch on the
number of the vibrations in any given space of time, or,
what amounts to the same thing, on the length of time
occupied by each vibration, and the <i>timbre</i> (also called
“tone”) on the form assumed by the vibrations or waves
of sound, that is to say, on the relations of the vibrations
one to the other.</p>

<p>There are but few musical instruments that produce a
simple tone; in fact, among those usually employed the
tuning-fork is almost the only one from which we can
hear it. All other musical tones result from a combination
of simple, or as they have sometimes been termed,
“partial” tones, whose double vibrations or “swing-swangs,”
as De Morgan named them, stand to one another
in the relation of 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. The Pythagoreans
of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> were already acquainted with
the fact that the respective lengths of the fundamental
note with its octave, fifth and fourth, must be as one to
two, as two to three, and as three to four.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> This fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
note, or deepest partial tone, is the starting-point
from which we ascend upwards; it forms the standard
by which the pitch or ascending scale of sounds is measured,
while the remaining partial tones go by the name of
the harmonics or upper tones. The partial tones coalesce
so closely into a full tone as almost to escape the notice
even of the trained ear, but their co-existence may be
easily detected by the help of resonatory instruments.
The full tones themselves, however, which we shall henceforth
call tones or notes,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> may not be able to make the
impression upon the nerves of hearing needful for conveying
a sense of sound to the brain within. The tone
produced by any number of vibrations less than sixteen
a second is wholly inaudible except by the help of the microphone,
and even this number of vibrations brings out
so deep a pitch as to be scarcely perceptible.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> “For
practical purposes,” says Professor Max Müller,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> “the
lowest tone we hear is produced by thirty double vibrations
in one second, the highest by 4,000. Between these
two lie the usual seven octaves of our musical instruments.
It is said to be possible, however, to produce perceptible
musical tones through eleven octaves, beginning with sixteen
and ending with 38,000 double vibrations in one second,
though here the lower notes are mere hums, the upper
notes mere clinks.” The sense of sound is not stronger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
and more trustworthy than the other senses of sight, of
touch, of taste, of smell. On all sides we are strictly limited
by the conditions which surround us, and even science,
though she may assist the senses by instruments which
enlarge and extend their powers, reaches at last a boundary
which she cannot pass. The world is a vast sounding-board,
even if we know it not; the infinitesimally
small and the infinitesimally great alike lie beyond our
apprehension. Above and below there is infinity, and
“the music of the spheres,” of which the old Greek
thinkers dreamed, is not, after all, so very far removed
from the truth that science has revealed to us. The notes
or partial tones that we hear are the purely mechanical
product of a definitely determined number of double
vibrations, and the variations in pitch we notice between
them are due to the length of time occupied by these vibrations.
If, for instance, one note takes half the time
another does, if the number of oscillations in the second
is twice that required by the fundamental note, the interval
between the two notes is what is called an octave. If,
again, the proportion between the two notes is as three
to two, three waves of the one occupying the same time
as two waves of the other, the interval between them
is a fifth; while a major sixth represents the interval
between two notes, which stand to each other as five to
three. Consequently, if we divide into two equal parts
a tense cord, which, when made to vibrate throughout
its whole length, yields its fundamental note, and vibrate
either part, we shall hear the octave above that
fundamental note. In other words, the number of the
vibrations of any two cords having the same degree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
of tension is (other things being equal) inversely as
their length. In the case of two elastic rods or rigid
tongues, the number of vibrations is inversely as the
square of the length; hence an elastic rod six inches
long will vibrate four times more rapidly than a rod of
the same material and equal thickness twelve inches
long. The number of vibrations is also dependent on
the thickness and tension of the cords or rods, being inversely
as the thickness of the cords and directly as the
thickness of the rods, and in both cases proportional to
the square root of their tension. It must be remembered
that membranous tongues like our own <i>chordæ vocales</i>,
act in accordance with the same general law as tense cords
and not as elastic rods.</p>

<p>Every body capable of producing sound has a tone
peculiar to itself; a stringed instrument, for instance, and
a trombone differ in the tones they give forth, and we
may even divide the air into definitely circumscribed
portions, or “chambers of resonance,” each of which will
have its own peculiar tone. The form assumed by the
double vibrations, the ultimate causes of sound, determines
these differences in the quality of the tones we hear.
Sometimes the vibrations will run in zigzag course through
the elastic medium; sometimes their shape will be
rounded; sometimes, again, it will be angular. The
simplest wave of sound, that produced by a tuning-fork,
flows in a succession of spiral lines, and the partial tones or
harmonics of other instruments may also be assumed to
be so many simple waves of sound of the same form. In
fact, even if a harmonic may be resolved into a combination
of other harmonics or partial tones, and these again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
into yet simpler and fainter harmonics, we must come at
last to simple notes, corresponding with the note emitted by
the tuning-fork and composed of vibrations that have the
same spiral shape. It is the varying amalgamation of
these simple spirals that occasions the varying forms of
the full tones; each full tone (the simple tone alone excepted)
being made up of harmonics and consequently of
their spirals in different proportions, and in this difference
of mixture lies the difference of quality in the tones we
hear.</p>

<p>Ohm, Fourier, and others first proved that the simple
pendulous oscillation is the only vibration unaccompanied
by harmonics, and that all full tones can be decomposed
into the simple vibrations of which they consist. Helmholtz
has now ascertained the exact form of many of
these compound tones, as well as the conditions under
which the by-notes or harmonics are present or absent. In
the violin, for example, as compared with the guitar or
the pianoforte, he finds that the primary note is strong,
the partial tones from two to six weak, and those from
seven to ten clearer and more distinct.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> He was first led
to detect the variations of form they assume by applying
a microscope to the vibrations of different musical
instruments, and the fact was further confirmed by the
discovery made by himself and Donders that the sounds
articulated by the human voice are composed of vibrations
which each assume their own special shape. The
phonautographs since constructed by Scott and König
actually delineate the forms of these waves of sound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
either on a plate of sand, or in the flickerings of a gas-flame,
or in the movements of a writing pencil, and the
microscopic examination of the impressions produced by
articulate sounds in the tinfoil of the phonograph shows
a series of indentations of various but determinate
shapes.</p>

<p>The number of forms which can be assumed by the
waves of sound is naturally limited in kind, while various
bodies may emit sounds containing the same harmonic or
partial tone. The quality or timbre which depends on
the relation and strength of these partial tones, and of
the composite form assumed by the sum of their vibrations,
constitutes what we have called a peculiar tone.
This, as we have seen, is a simple one in the case of the
tuning-fork, but in other cases it forms part of a full
or complex group. We may find an illustration in the
characteristic lines of light which we learn from the
spectrum analysis are projected by substances; where we
are dealing with a simple elementary substance, the line
thrown upon the spectrum is correspondingly simple;
where, on the other hand, the substance is compound, its
spectrum also is compound, reflecting the several chemical
elements of which it is made up. The simple spectrum
answers to the simple harmonic or partial tone with its
varying pitch and invariable form, just as the compound
spectrum answers to the full note or peculiar tone with
its characteristic quality and diversified grouping of partial
tones. Now, if a body which has a certain peculiar
tone is struck by a sound which contains a partial tone in
any way similar to this peculiar tone, the body in question
vibrates in sympathy, and we hear what is known as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
a by-note or harmonic. This by-note reacts upon the
partial tone which has caused it, strengthening the partial
tone and so modifying the quality of the complex
sound. If, for instance, we play a note such as C on a
violin, the strings of a piano representing C as well as
the harmonics allied to it will vibrate in sympathy. Of
course the more elastic the body which is struck, the
louder and clearer will be the by-note, and of all elastic
bodies none are better than those chambers of resonance
into which we can divide the air. Such chambers of resonance
are afforded by wind instruments of all kinds,
whose shape determines the peculiar tone they are to emit.
If the instrument is so constructed as to change its shape
at will, now round, now straight, now broad, now narrow,
the number of different chambers of resonance, and consequently
the number of different peculiar tones, may be
almost indefinitely increased.</p>

<p>It is this variability of form which makes the human
throat such a marvellous instrument for the production
of manifold sounds. Like most chambers of resonance,
it has the hollow reed-like shape which connects
it most readily with the primary source of sound. In
analyzing the material of language we must never forget
that we have to do with the most perfect wind instrument
that exists, a wind instrument, too, of infinite pliability
and power of change, and thus in constant and
ready sympathy with the harmonics that are struck by
the other organs of speech.</p>

<p>We must now pass from the science of acoustics to the
science of physiology. We have seen what are the conditions
under which musical notes are produced, we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
also seen that among these musical notes the utterances
of articulate speech have to be classed; we have next to
examine into the nature and conformation of the physical
organs to which these utterances owe their origin. In
the first place, the organs of speech may roughly be
divided into three groups:—the breathing apparatus, or
lungs, the <i>trachea</i> or windpipe with larynx and bronchial
tubes, and the chamber of resonance or mouth and nose.
The lungs provide the material which is worked up into
inarticulate noises and articulate sounds by the <i>trachea</i>
and chamber of resonance. As long as the breath flows
out of the throat and mouth quietly and without interruption
language of any sort is out of the question. The
organs of speech are at rest, and all that can be done is
to propel the breath with greater or less violence. We
may breathe hard through the mouth, we may even make
noises like that of snorting through the nose, but as yet
there is nothing which can constitute a starting-point for
articulate speech.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Mere <i>breath</i>, as distinguished from
<i>voice</i>, only supplies the material out of which words and
sentences may afterwards be created. Voice is breath,
acted upon and excited into waves of sound by the organs
of the throat and mouth; a larger quantity of air than is
needed for simple breathing is rapidly taken into the
lungs, and immediately expelled in intermittent gusts,
but with varying degrees of force. Almost all the sounds
we utter are accompanied by exspiration; only such
sounds as an occasionally mispronounced <i>ja</i> in Germany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
or our own surprised <i>Oh!</i> are produced while the
breath is being drawn in. Experiment will at once
show how difficult it is to pronounce a sound at the same
time that this is being done.</p>

<p>The breath, then, is the passive instrument through
which language is formed by the trachea and chamber
of resonance. This trachea is a long cartilaginous and
elastic pipe ending in the bronchial tubes, through which
the air is admitted to the lungs. Its upper part is termed
the larynx, consisting of five cartilages and situated in
the throat. The lowest of these cartilages is the <i>cricoid</i>,
which resembles a ring with the broad flat surface turned
downwards. Over this comes the <i>cartilago thyroidea</i> or
Adam’s apple, with two wings which partly enclose the
<i>cartilago cricoidea</i>, and form a link between it and the
<i>os hyoideum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> or bone of the tongue, which has somewhat
of the shape of a horseshoe. The space surrounded by
these two cartilages may be compared with a hollow
reed, out of the back part of which a piece has been cut.
From the base of the latter and the upper rim of the
<i>cartilago cricoidea</i> spring two small pyramidal cartilages,
the arytenoids, which resemble the horns of an ox
and almost touch one another. Their roots are connected
with one another and with the cricoid and
thyroid cartilages by the so-called <i>processus vocales</i>,
which in spite of their name have little to do with
the formation of speech. The horns of the arytenoids
serve to unite two elastic bands to the opposite surface
of the thyroid cartilage. These bands are formed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
muscle enveloped with mucous membrane, and are the
famous <i>chordæ vocales</i> upon which as upon the strings of
a piano the manifold modulations of human language
are played. So long as they remain, the other vocal
organs, not excluding the tongue, may be removed without
depriving the patient of the faculty of articulate
speech.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Their length differs in men and women, in
children and adults; the average length in men being
about one-third greater than in women, and occasioning
the different pitch of male and female voices.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The two
<i>chordæ vocales</i> run obliquely across the cavity enclosed
between the thyroid cartilage and a small projection on
the front part of the arytenoid cartilage, an aperture which
is called the glottis, or <i>glottis vera</i>. They can be relaxed
or contracted at will by the muscles of the cartilages to
which they are attached, and a portion of them can even
be deadened by pressure from a small protuberance on
the under side of the epiglottis. The glottis itself is
divided into two parts, one the space between the vocal
chords and the lateral thyro-arytenoid and crico-arytenoid
cartilages, the other the triangular space between the
vocal chords themselves, the latter allowing a passage
for breath, the former a passage for voice. Both spaces
can of course be narrowed or enlarged by the contraction
or relaxation of the vocal chords, and the junction of the
latter will close one or both altogether. It is in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
secret chamber that the phonetic substance of speech is
moulded into shape; the vibrations of the <i>chordæ vocales</i>
in the breath of the glottis are the ultimate cause of
syllables and words.</p>

<p>Above this chamber of the voice the trachea or windpipe
again widens, and a second chamber is formed by
two cavities on either side, called the ventricles of the
larynx (the <i>ventriculi Morgagni</i>). Each cavity leads, at
the back, into a pouch of the mucous membrane called the
laryngeal sac and covered with sixty or seventy mucous
glands, the secretion from which acts like oil on a piece
of machinery by keeping the vocal chords and the surrounding
parts in a moist condition. Stretched across
the cavities are two thick ligaments, the false vocal
chords, like the true <i>chordæ vocales</i> below them. They
differ from the vocal chords in having no muscle of
their own, but like the latter can contract or enlarge at
pleasure the false glottis (<i>glottis spuria</i>), the space, that
is, which is enclosed between them. The false glottis,
which, like the false vocal chords, takes no part in the
creation of language, is shut by an elastic cartilage, called
the <i>epiglottis</i>, the lower point of which is attached to the
thyroid cartilage immediately above the <i>chordæ vocales</i>,
while the upper end broadens out like a leaf and falls
over the fissure of the false glottis. This corresponds
with the entrance of the larynx. The upper surface of
the epiglottis is concave, and in swallowing it is allowed
to drop upon the larynx. At other times it may be
depressed over the false and true vocal chords.</p>

<p>Such is the machinery whereby breath from the lungs
is transformed into voice in its passage through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
windpipe; and voice is next taken up by what we
have termed the chamber of resonance and modified in
various ways. If we may call the glottis the manufactory
of voice, we may call the mouth and nose the manufactory
of the articulate sounds into which voice is
divided. At the back of the epiglottis lies the <i>pharynx</i>,
leading into the <i>œsophagus</i>, and the pharynx is bounded
on the side of the mouth by the posterior pillar or
<i>arcus pharyngo-palatinus</i>, opposite to which is the anterior
pillar or <i>arcus glosso-palatinus</i>. Between them
are the tonsils, and above these again the <i>uvula</i>, a
sort of pendent valve which hangs downwards from
the top of the anterior pillar towards the posterior pillar
behind. The uvula is attached to a piece of yielding
muscle known as the soft palate or <i>velum palati</i>, which
with the uvula separates the throat from the entrance to
the nostrils. The soft palate can move either backwards
or forwards; in pronouncing the guttural (<i>ng</i>) for instance,
it is pressed forward against the tongue, shutting off the
throat; in pronouncing the vowels, on the other hand, it
is pressed backward, and so cuts off the flow of breath
to the nose. Above the soft palate comes the arch of
the hard palate or roof of the mouth, and below this the
tongue with its two roots and pointed tip. The teeth that
enclose the mouth, along with their alveolars that form the
front wall of the hard palate, have much to do with the
formation of specific sounds, while it is hardly necessary
to refer to the phonological importance of both nose and
lips. As is well known, a leading characteristic of cultivated
English is the little use it makes of the latter.</p>

<p>It is now time to consider the precise parts played by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
these different organs of speech, in producing the various
elements of spoken language. We must begin by putting
out of sight all inarticulate sounds or noises, such as the
clicks of the Bushman or the Hottentot, which have entered
into the composition and framework of actual speech.
Such inarticulate sounds are but the stepping-stones to
real language, the first steps of the ladder, as it were,
which were eventually to lead to articulate words. They
are the natural cries of man like the natural cries of the
animals from which they in no way differ; and just as
on the one side the barking of the dog and the mewing
of the cat are said to be attempts to imitate the human
voice, so on the other hand the inarticulate cries of the
<i>infant</i> or “non-speaker” are on the same level as the
roar of the lion or the shriek of the cockatoo. We are told
that the cynocephalic ape of the Upper Senegal, whose
form is depicted on the monuments of ancient Egypt,
utters clicks which sometimes contain a distinct <i>d</i>,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and
the Bushmen themselves show a true instinct when they
make the beasts in their fables talk not only with the
clicks of the Bushman dialects, but even in the case of
some animals with clicks that do not otherwise occur.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
If we watch the first endeavours of children to speak, we
may discover inarticulate noises gradually becoming
articulate sounds with definite meanings, and we may
even trace a recollection of the first efforts of man to
create a language for himself in the guttural aspirates
heard for instance in some of the Semitic dialects.
Indeed, the name given to the hard breathing (<i>h</i>) by
the Greeks, πνεῦμα δασύ or “rough aspirate,” reminds
us of the guttural noises, not yet phonetic sounds, made
by the child; in forming this sound we jerk out the
breath at the same time that we narrow the glottis,
adding if we like various degrees of hoarseness by further
stopping its free flow. The glottal catch, which is heard
in Danish after vowels, and according to Mr. Bell is substituted
in the Glasgow pronunciation for “voiceless
stops,” is really a mere cough. Even the <i>spiritus lenis</i> or
soft breathing, heard before a vowel, partakes in some
measure of the nature of a noise. It is true that the
rough breathing cannot be sung while the soft breathing
may be; but this is because in the case of the
latter the breath is checked near the vocal chords and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
can therefore be intoned. Professor Max Müller is
doubtless right in holding that all that the Greeks meant
by πνεῦμα ψιλόν as opposed to πνεῦμα δασύ was “a negative
definition of another breath which is free from roughness,”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
just as the ĕ-´psilon is negatively contrasted with the <i>êta</i>.
Neither breathing was regarded as constituting as yet a
true sound or “voice.”</p>

<p>The true sounds of language, however, were distinguished
but roughly and imperfectly one from the other.
Plato, in his Kratylus, divides them into φονηέντα or
“vowels,” and ἄφωνα or “mutes,” these last being further
subdivided into semi-vowels which are neither vowels nor
mutes (φωνηέντα μὲν οὔ, οὐ μέντοι γε ἄφθογγα) and ἄφθογγα or real
mutes. The term ἄφωνα, mutes, afterwards came to be
restricted in its sense as a simple equivalent of Plato’s
ἄφθογγα, its place being taken by the term σύμφωνα or “consonants,”
letters, that is to say, which must be sounded
along with a vowel. These consonants were next classed
as ἡμίφωνα or semi-vowels (<i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>s</i>), ὑγρά or “liquids”
which covered all the semi-vowels with the exception of
<i>s</i>, and ἄφωνα or “mutes.” The mutes fall into three
classes, the ψιλά or “bare” (<i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i>), the δασέα or “aspirates”
(<i>kh</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>ph</i>) and the μέσα which stood, as it were,
“between” them. The Latin translation of the latter
term has given us the <i>mediæ</i> of modern grammars.</p>

<p>Far more thorough-going and scientific were the phonological
labours and classification of the Hindu <i>prâtiśâkhyas</i>.
Instead of starting from written speech like the Greek
grammarians, they had to do with an orally-delivered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
literature, and hence while the Greeks never got beyond
the belief that the tongue, teeth, and lips were the sole
instruments of pronunciation, the Hindus had carefully
analyzed the organs of speech some centuries before the
Christian era, and composed phonological treatises which
may favourably compare with those of our own day.
They knew, for example, that in sounding the <i>tenues</i>, or
hard letters, the glottis is kept open, while in sounding
the <i>mediæ</i>, or soft ones, it is closed; they knew also
that <i>e</i> and <i>o</i> were diphthongs analyzable into <i>a</i> + <i>i</i> and
<i>a</i> + <i>u</i>; and they explained <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>, <i>p</i> and <i>b</i>, as formed
by complete contact of the vocal organs. They had noted
the <i>repha</i> or “Newcastle burr,” and had divided the nasals
into their several classes. The names they gave to the
various sounds, and the groups into which they were
classified, were descriptive of their mode of formation,
like the names similarly applied by modern phonologists.
Thus the guttural sibilant formed near the root of the
tongue (χ) was called <i>Jihvâmûlîya</i>, “the tongue-root
letter,” and the labial sibilant (φ) <i>Upadhmânîya</i>, “to be
breathed upon.” The consonants were classed both according
to the place where they were formed, and according
to their <i>prayatna</i>, or “quality,” the mutes and nasals,
for instance, being formed by “complete contact” of the
vocal organs, the semi-vowels by “<i>slight</i> contact” (<i>îshat
sprishṭa</i>), the sibilants by “slight opening” (<i>îshad vivṛita</i>),
and the vowels by complete opening. A controversy
even sprung up among the grammarians as to the extent
of this opening of the organs. “Some ascribe to the semi-vowels
<i>duḥspṛishṭa</i>, imperfect contact, or <i>îshadaspṛishṭa</i>,
slight non-contact, or <i>îshadvivṛita</i>, slight opening; to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
sibilants <i>nemaspṛishṭa</i>, half-contact; <i>i.e.</i>, greater opening
than is required for the semi-vowels, or <i>vivṛita</i>, complete
opening; while they require for the vowels either <i>vivṛita</i>,
complete opening, or <i>aspṛishṭa</i>, non-contact.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Leaving the speculations of the past, let us now pass
on to the results which have been obtained by modern
research. Thanks to the labours of men like Alexander
Ellis, Melville Bell, Helmholtz, Czermak, Brücke, Sweet,
and others, the mechanism of speech has been fairly
settled; and though many points are still open to discussion,
the main facts have been thoroughly ascertained
and adequately explained. We have learnt the real
nature and causes of those phonetic elements of speech
which the old grammarians first tried to separate and
classify; we have cleared away the confusion from which
even the Vedic scholars of India could not wholly escape,
and have discovered that in phonology as elsewhere, the
convenient systems of practical life do not bear a close
scientific investigation. Even the ordinary distinction of
vowels and consonants is exposed to more than one objection.
It rests not upon the essential character of the
sounds themselves, but upon mere differences of function,
and its advocates have to invent a series of semi-vowels
or semi-consonants, a name which of itself indicates how
incomplete and unsatisfactory the distinction must be.
The distinction, indeed, has a basis of fact, but the fact is
one which has been misapprehended or overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>Apart from the respiratory organs which supply the
fuel, the chief agents in the manufacture of speech are
the throat and mouth. The breath, as it makes its way
upward, passes the vocal chords, causing these to vibrate;
and while the forms taken by the vibrations determine
the quality or timbre of the sound to be uttered, the
very essence of a vowel, for instance, consisting in the
quality of the voice, the number of the vibrations determines
its pitch.</p>

<p>In the pitch we have to distinguish between two things,
the chest or true notes and the head or falsetto notes,
respectively due to the position and action of the vocal
chords. In the chest notes the vocal chords are stiffened
and laid side by side, so that when the flow of breath comes
from the lungs, they are forced aside for a moment, to
spring back the next and cause a series of intermittent
puffs of breath. In the falsetto notes, on the other hand,
the muscles of the vocal chords are not contracted, nor is
the glottis wholly closed; hence only the inner membrane
of the chords is set in motion by the breath, and instead
of actually meeting one another, the chords merely narrow
or enlarge the aperture of the glottis.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>The forms assumed by the vibrations depend, of course,
on the anatomical structure of the vocal chords, their
greater or less elasticity, and the like. Besides quality
and pitch, however, we must also take account of the
<i>intensity</i> of the sound, this intensity or emphasis arising
from the force with which the stream of breath is expelled
from the lungs, and the corresponding strain of the muscles
of the trachea and vocal chords.</p>

<p>In whispering, the amount of intensity is considerably
diminished, though the pitch is quite as distinct as in loud
voice. The glottis is not completely closed, but the upward
flow of breath is not strong enough to do more
than produce a sort of friction, or imperfect vibration in
the vocal chords. The latter incline towards each other
on the side furthest from the arytenoids, and so give the
glottis a triangular shape; the larynx, however, may also
assume other forms. Hence it is that we may distinguish
three kinds of whispered voice. We may either have a
soft whisper, where the whole glottis is narrowed, and the
force with which the breath is emitted is very slight; or
a medium whisper, where the force is greater, and only
that part of the glottis left open which lies between the
arytenoids; or a loud whisper, where the force is considerable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
the false vocal chords are in close contact, and
the epiglottis bent stiffly downwards, allowing but a very
small opening for the escape of the breath. A loud
whisper is rare; a medium whisper the most common.
Sighing, it may be added, is produced above the larynx,
which takes no part in its production; when the vocal
chords are brought into action, the sigh becomes a groan.</p>

<p>It needs but a short experience to discover the numberless
varieties of voice that may exist, and it is not uncommon
for a blind man by this means not only to
distinguish the age and sex of those he meets, but even
to recognize his friends. In fact the human voice, from
the deepest male to the highest female voice, has a range
of nearly four octaves, the lowest note being E, produced
by 80 vibrations per second, and the highest C, produced
by 1,024 vibrations per second. But Vierordt has shown
that in extreme cases its range is nearly 5½ octaves, from
F (produced by 42 vibrations) to A (produced by 1,708
vibrations). In the same individual it is rare for the
range of the voice to be more than two octaves, and in
ordinary speech it is generally only half an octave. These
different notes are due to changes in the length and tension
of the vocal chords and their approximation or
separation, the lower notes, for instance, requiring them
to be longer, looser, and more widely separated than in
the case of the higher notes, and consequently to admit a
larger but less rapid current of air. It has been calculated
that 240 different states of tension of the vocal chords
must be accurately producible at will, in order to cause
all the notes and intermediate tones heard in a perfect
voice of ordinary range. Madame Mara could effect no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
fewer than 2,000 changes. The four chief varieties of the
voice—the bass, the tenor, the contralto, and the soprano—are
dependent on differences of pitch, that is ultimately
on differences in the length of the vocal chords. The bass
and the tenor with the intermediate baritone characterize
the man, the contralto and soprano with the intermediate
mezzo-soprano characterize the woman. The lowest note
of the contralto is about an octave higher than the lowest
note of the bass, the highest soprano about an octave
higher than the highest tenor. Sometimes, however, we
find a bass voice singing the higher notes of a tenor, and
yet at the same time remaining bass. The reason of this
is that the various kinds of voice differ not only in pitch,
but also in timbre. This is caused by differences in the
vocal organs. The larynx of women is smaller than that
of men; the angle formed by it in front is less acute, and
the cartilages are softer. The voice of boys is either contralto
or soprano, like that of women, though generally
different in tone. There is, however, no difference in the
larynx of either boys or girls up to the age of puberty,
when in the case of boys it rapidly increases in size, and
the vocal chords become longer, thicker, and coarser.</p>

<p>The elevation or depression of the larynx exercises a certain
modifying influence upon the voice. When the voice is
raised from a low to a high pitch, the whole larynx, together
with the trachea, is lifted towards the base of the skull.
The exact way, however, in which the trachea and the
parts above the glottis affect the voice is by no means
clear. The thyro-arytenoid muscles, which extend from
the arytenoids to the recessed angle of the thyroid cartilage,
have much to do with the production of these higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
tones. They narrow the diameter of the larynx just below
the vocal chords, and the diminution of the calibre of the
wind-tube nearest the chords thus occasioned heightens
the pitch. On the other hand, the pitch is made to fall
by semitones when the tube is lengthened. In short, the
greater the strength of the current of air the higher is the
pitch. The depression of the larynx produces the so-called
veiled voice (<i>vox clandestina</i>), the larynx itself
being then covered by the entire pharynx, the root of the
tongue approximated to the palate, and the voice being
thus made to resound in the upper part of the pharynx
under the skull.</p>

<p>The precise nature of ventriloquism is not quite certain.
J. Müller states that it may be produced by speaking
through an extremely narrow glottis, during a very slow
exspiration, performed only by the lateral walls of the
chest, a deep inspiration having been first taken, so as
to cause the protrusion of the abdominal viscera by
the descent of the diaphragm. Magendie, however, considers
it to be produced in the larynx by variously modifying
the voice so as to imitate the changes otherwise
effected in it by distance.</p>

<p>The character of the voice is necessarily modified by
changes in the structure of the vocal organs, whether due
to old age, to weather and climate, to exhaustion, or to
disease. In old age the ossification of the cartilages, the
diminution of muscular and nervous power, and the degeneration
of the larynx, make the voice weak, tremulous,
and “piping.” In damp chilly weather the voice is often
lowered by as much as two or three notes: indeed, nothing
affects it more rapidly than a damp and depressing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
atmosphere. Exhaustion, again, accounts for the dissonance
sometimes perceived in the voice of singers, while
inflammation of the lining membrane of the larynx, and
other diseases, will impair or wholly destroy the power of
utterance. Loss of voice during a bad cold is a familiar
instance of the latter fact.</p>

<p>Lisping, stammering, and other kinds of imperfect
speech, are mainly due to nervous disease, stammering
being usually caused by temporary spasm of the glottis.
Too high a palate is another cause of irregular utterance.
Dumbness, when not occasioned by deafness, as is generally
the case, must be ascribed either to malformation of
the vocal organs, or, more commonly, to disease of the
nervous centres. Whistling, it must be remembered, results
from the vibration caused by the friction of the
breath against the edges of the open lips, and is wholly
formed in the mouth.</p>

<p>The mouth, or chamber of resonance, is especially important
for the creation of articulate speech. On the one
side there are a great many sounds which owe to it their
origin, on the other side even the sounds which are formed
in the throat are necessarily modified in passing through
the mouth. While <i>t</i>, <i>p</i>, or <i>k</i> have no existence until the
voiced breath has reached the region of the mouth, the
vowels which are formed in the throat cannot be heard in
their pure and original state, but must pass through a
chamber of resonance and so become more or less transformed.
The throat, again, may remain passive, but the
mouth must always be active. Of course the mouth
forms a chamber of resonance not only for the sounds
produced by the throat, but also for those produced by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
itself; the larger part of the mouth, for instance, forms a
chamber of resonance for the palatal <i>ch</i>. We must remember,
moreover, that a sound can be more variously
changed and modified, the larger and more variable is the
part of the mouth which serves as a chamber of resonance,
that is to say, the further back the place is in which it is
manufactured. The vowels consequently come first in
capability of modification, then the gutturals and dentals,
and finally the labials. It has often been observed that
children when learning to speak are apt to change a
guttural into a dental, and say <i>do</i> instead of <i>go</i>, the
guttural being formed further back than the dental, and
so undergoing a greater amount of modification in its
passage through the mouth.</p>

<p>A vowel is voice freely emitted through the throat and
mouth without interruption, and modified only by the
different positions assumed by the tongue. The essence
of a vowel is the quality or timbre of the voiced breath,
and this quality, as we have already seen, is due to the
varying forms taken by the vibrating vocal chords when
played upon by the breath. Necessarily, however, the
quality of the voice as it leaves the throat must be
always the same, since the throat is a musical instrument
which possesses its own peculiar tone. What,
then, is the cause of the differences we notice in the
quality of the vowels? Simply the mobility of what we
have called the chamber of resonance, the manifold shapes
the organs of the mouth are able to assume being so many
musical instruments, each with its peculiar tone. The
partial tones or harmonics which go to make up the quality
of the voiced breath are strengthened by the corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
peculiar tones of the several shapes assumed by the
mouth, while at the same time those harmonics which do
not agree with the peculiar tones are dulled or deadened.
Hence a vowel is the quality of voiced breath produced
by a combination of the forms of the vibrations of
the vocal chords with those of the vibrating air in the
various shapes taken by the chamber of resonance. The
pitch of the vowel depends of course on the number of
vibrations during the time of utterance, and may be
detected even when the vowel is whispered. Indeed, as
Donders and Helmholtz have shown, every vowel has its
characteristic pitch, whether it is voiced or whispered.
The different vowels can be heard in cases of aphonia,
where the vocal chords are more or less paralyzed, while
the <i>vox clandestina</i> is able to rise or fall. This is explained
by the fact that even in whispering a certain friction is
exercised on the vocal chords. If, for instance, we whisper
the sound of <i>ü</i>, and then let the whisper gradually pass
into a whistle, we shall always get the same tone, and
Professor Max Müller thinks that the indications of
musical pitch in the whispered vowels must be treated as
“imperfect tones; that is to say, as noises approaching
to tones, or as irregular vibrations, nearly, yet not quite,
changed into regular or isochronous vibrations.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The number of possible vowel-sounds is almost infinite.
The vocal chamber of resonance is almost infinitely variable
in the forms it may assume, and it is in these forms,
as we have seen, that we must find the origin of the
vowels and their <i>nuances</i> of sound. In Prince L.-L.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
Bonaparte’s alphabet, as given in Mr. A. J. Ellis’s “Early
English Pronunciation,” seventy-five vowel-sounds (exclusive
of <i>ḷ</i> and <i>ṛ</i>) are distinguished from one another, ten of
which occur in no actual language, and of the remaining
sixty-five, fifty occur each in less than nine European
dialects. For practical purposes, however, it is necessary
to analyze the formation of those vowels only which are
heard most usually in spoken language, always remembering
that the <i>nuances</i> of which these are capable are
nearly unlimited, and that the same speaker is constantly
varying what he intends and believes to be the same
vowel-sound. Speaking generally, we may say that in
pronouncing the vowels we invariably raise the tongue
towards the palate, but not so as to touch it—as in the
case of the consonants—the lips being passive in some
instances, and rounded in others. It is needless to note
that in phonology, as in all other departments of the
science of language, the Italian pronunciation of the
vowels must be adopted. Our erroneous pronunciation
of the vowel-symbols is not one of the least important
reasons for urging a reform of English spelling.</p>

<p>The three fundamental vowels, round which all the
others group themselves, are <i>a</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>u</i>; and though it is
not necessary to hold that these were the first vowel-sounds
articulated by man, it is necessary to regard them,
for analytical purposes, as the primary elements to which
the rest may be ultimately referred. According to Winteler,
these three vowels must be arranged in a straight
line, of which <i>i</i> forms one end and <i>u</i> the other, <i>a</i> standing
in the middle.</p>

<p>In forming <i>a</i> the tongue is in a more constrained position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
than in the case of any other vowel; it lies flat and
retracted, while the lips are wide open. Helmholtz
makes its inherent tone <span class="allsmcap">B″</span> flat. Owing to the constrained
position of the tongue, this vowel is more liable to be
modified than any other; the “neutral” <i>a</i> is scarcely
ever heard, produced as it is by the gradual narrowing of
the movement of the tongue from the back of the mouth,
where the obscure <i>a</i> of <i>father</i> is heard, to the front of the
mouth, where we get the broad <i>ä</i> of <i>pair</i>. This neutral
<i>a</i> which may be heard in the Italian <i>ămātă</i> is not the
“natural” sound it is sometimes called; different parts of
the mouth must be modified to create it, occasioning the
nasal sound we perceive in moaning if the mouth remains
passive, or the shrill <i>ä</i> of the new-born child, if the nasal
orifice is closed by the elevation of the soft palate.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The
belief that language was once in a stage in which the
neutral <i>a</i> was the only vowel known is contradicted by
the facts of phonology.</p>

<p>A stronger effort of articulation is required for <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>.
The lips must be slightly opened, the larynx raised, and
the tongue pushed upward, so that its front approaches
the hard palate, if we want to produce <i>i</i>, the natural pitch
of which is said to be <span class="allsmcap">D⁗</span>. The movement of the tongue
from the back to the front of the mouth, with a gradual
narrowing of the air passage, forms both the <i>i</i> of <i>mill</i>, and
the <i>i</i> of <i>meal</i>.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> As we shall see, the position of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
tongue in forming <i>i</i> approaches that required for forming
the palatals, and thus explains the relationship that
exists between them. For <i>u</i> the tongue is raised towards
the soft palate, the larynx lowered, and the lips rounded;
hence the connection between this vowel and the labials.
Its connection with the gutturals, as illustrated by the
change of <i>werra</i> into <i>guerre</i>, or <i>vespa</i> into <i>guêpe</i>, is explained
by the position of the tongue, which approaches
the soft palate in forming <i>u</i>, and touches it in forming <i>k</i>
or <i>g</i>. The rounded shape of the mouth needed by <i>u</i>, as
compared with its narrow neck-like appearance needed
by <i>i</i>, strengthens the deep partial tones, and dulls the
sharp ones, thus occasioning the converse effect of <i>i</i>. In
fact, <i>u</i> is essentially the vowel of the bass, <i>i</i> of the soprano.
The inherent tone of <i>u</i> is <span class="allsmcap">F</span>.</p>

<p>It is obvious that an almost endless series of modifications
may be made in the primary vowels by slight
changes in the position of the organs by which they are
produced. Between <i>a</i> and <i>i</i> stands <i>e</i>; between <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>, <i>o</i>.
In pronouncing <i>e</i> the tongue is less raised than in pronouncing
<i>i</i>; for <i>o</i>, the back of the tongue is less raised
and the lips more widely opened than for <i>u</i>. In <i>o</i>, however,
as in <i>u</i>, the lips have to come into play; hence it
is that these two sounds are so frequently weakened to <i>e</i>
and <i>i</i>, whereas the converse change never takes place.
In <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> we have a simple and not a double action.
According to Helmholtz, the inherent pitch of <i>o</i> is <span class="allsmcap">B′</span> flat,
of <i>e</i>, <span class="allsmcap">B‴</span> flat or <span class="allsmcap">F′</span>.</p>

<p>But <i>e</i> and <i>o</i> may again undergo considerable change.
If while pronouncing close <i>e</i> (as in the French <i>été</i> or
German <i>see</i>) we round the lips, the sound is produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
which is represented by <i>ö</i> in Middle and Southern German
and <i>eu</i> in French, the short sound of which may be
heard in the German <i>böcke</i>. It lies, it will be observed,
between <i>e</i> and <i>o</i>, and its inherent pitch is <span class="allsmcap">C‴</span> sharp.
Closely related to this <i>ö</i> is the German <i>ü</i>, French <i>u</i>. This
sound is produced by rounding the lips when the organs
of speech are in position for pronouncing <i>i</i>, which explains
the use of <i>ü</i> and <i>i</i> as rhyming equivalents in German
poetry. <i>Ü</i> consequently lies between <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>, though,
from another point of view, it may be described as standing
furthest from <i>a</i> in a series of which <i>ö</i> forms the centre.
The inherent pitch of <i>ü</i> is <span class="allsmcap">G‴</span>.</p>

<p>Besides <i>o</i>, we have also the sound heard long in words
like <i>bought</i> or <i>aúgust</i>, and short in words like <i>not</i> and
<i>augúst</i>, formed by slightly depressing the tongue, widening
the air-passage, and rounding the lips to a less extent
than in the case of <i>o</i>.</p>

<p>Other vowel-sounds which may be noticed are the <i>e</i> of
the French <i>prêtre</i>, German <i>väter</i>, whose natural pitch is
made <span class="allsmcap">G″</span> or <span class="allsmcap">D‴</span>, the closely related open <i>e</i> (<i>ä</i>) of the English
<i>pair</i>, the short <i>a</i> of English closed syllables like <i>hat</i> or
<i>happy</i>, the short <i>e</i> of the English <i>men</i>, and the short <i>i</i> of
the English <i>hit</i>, <i>pill</i>. These short vowels are in great
measure due to the little use made of the lips in articulation,
and the compensatory exercise of the tongue, which
characterize modern English. It is small wonder that we
experience so much difficulty in pronouncing <i>ö</i> and <i>ü</i>,
when even our <i>u</i> is uttered with lips scarcely at all
rounded. On the other hand, whenever we find these
sounds in a language, we may conclude that we have
to do with a speech which gives the lips their full share<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
in articulation. Sievers would call those vowels <i>passive</i>
in which all the organs of speech needed for their clear
pronunciation are not brought into play, fully pronounced
vowels being termed <i>active</i>.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The same lazy pronunciation of cultivated English
which has almost dispensed with the service of the lips is
the cause of the increasing preponderance of the so-called
neutral vowel heard in such words as <i>but</i>, <i>virtue</i>, <i>dove</i>,
<i>bird</i>, <i>oven</i>. Except in affected pronunciation we may detect
it in most unaccented syllables, especially if they
happen to be final; thus we have <i>diligĕnce</i>, <i>muttŏn</i>,
<i>ăgainst</i>, <i>finăl</i>, <i>evĭl</i>, <i>valuăblĕ</i>. So, too, as Professor Max
Müller remarks, “<i>town</i> sinks to <i>Paddingtŏn</i>, <i>ford</i> to
<i>Oxfŏrd</i>.” He believes it to be pronounced with non-sonant
or whispered breath.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Mr. A. J. Ellis would make
it voice in its least modified form; and Mr. Sweet regards
it as a mere voice-glide. The “indistinct” vowel heard
in Arabic words by travellers seems to be identical with
it. Its existence in a language is a sign of age and decay;
meaning has become more important than outward
form, and the educated intelligence no longer demands a
clear pronunciation in order to understand what is said.
The participation of all the organs of speech in the
creation of vowel-sounds is, on the contrary, a mark of
linguistic freshness and youth. When we find both
tongue and lips equally active in the formation of <i>u</i> and
<i>i</i>, we may feel pretty sure that we are in the presence of
an uncultivated dialect. Vowels formed by combining
the position of the tongue required for <i>u</i> with that of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
lips required for <i>i</i> are extremely rare in Aryan speech;
an exceptional instance is to be met with in the Russian
<i>jery</i> (<i>y</i>).</p>

<p>But we must never forget the infinite capability of
modification possessed by a vowel. The same vowel-sound
of the same word is not only apt to be pronounced
differently by two natives of the same country, but even
by the speaker himself at different times, particularly if
his attention has been directed to his pronunciation of
the sound in question. It is true that the shades of difference
between the sounds may be so fine as to escape
all but the specially trained ear; but this does not prove
them to be any the less real. Putting aside quantity,
accent, emphasis, or accidental alteration in the vocal
organs, it is difficult to pronounce the same word twice
over in exactly the same way, so far, at least, as its
vowels are concerned. It is not wonderful, therefore,
that it is in their vowels that dialects soonest and most
easily alter, and that the vowel-system is the best guide
in mapping out the several stages in the history of a language.
Of course the character of a vowel-sound is
materially affected by its position in a word, or by the
consonants with which it is associated; the pronunciation
of the same vowel varies in a closed or an open syllable.
Long and short vowels, too, differ not only quantitatively,
but qualitatively also. Every vowel has both its own
peculiar pitch and a pitch dependent on the length of the
vocal chords. The peculiar pitch is the result of the
resonance-chamber in which the vowel is formed. The
high pitch of <i>i</i> is due to the narrow air-passage in the
front of the mouth in which it is produced, while the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
lowered pitch of <i>a</i> and <i>u</i> is caused in the one case by the
greater size of the resonance-chamber, and in the other
by the narrow opening of the lips. The same pitch may
be produced by different modifications of the same resonance-chamber.
Thus the French <i>eu</i> in <i>fleur</i>, produced
by slightly raising the front part of the tongue and
rounding the lips, has the same pitch as the English <i>e</i> in
<i>err</i>, produced without any rounding of the lips at all.</p>

<p>But we have not yet finished with the vowels. The
mouth is not the only agent concerned with their production.
Brücke<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> asserts that the bones of the skull itself
participate in the vibration caused by the utterance of the
high-pitched vowels. However this may be, the larynx,
the posterior wall of the pharynx, and the <i>velum pendulum</i>,
or soft palate, with the uvula attaching to it, have all to
do with the creation of vowel-sounds. Czermak has
proved by experiment that the <i>velum pendulum</i> changes
its place with each vowel that is uttered, rising successively
for the pronunciation of <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, and <i>i</i>. The nasal
orifice, too, is closed during the pronunciation of some
vowels, and more or less open during that of others. <i>A</i>
and <i>e</i> were the only two vowels which a young man
named Leblanc, whose larynx was completely closed,
was able to utter; while, on the other hand, experiment
has shown that with <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i> the passage to the nose is
shut, slightly open with <i>e</i>, and considerably open with <i>a</i>.
From this it will be seen that the term “nasal vowel” is
a misnomer. Nasal vowels, in fact, are produced by dropping
the uvula, and so allowing the air to vibrate freely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
through the cavities which connect the nose with the
pharynx. So far from a passage of the air through the
nose being necessary, we may even increase the nasal
twang by stopping the nostrils. The strength of the
nasalization depends on the distance of the <i>velum pendulum</i>,
or soft palate, from the tongue; and in languages
like French, in which much use is made of nasalized
vowels, the vowel is frequently followed by a true guttural
nasal. It has often been noticed that French, in
spite of its strong tendency to nasalize the vowels, has no
nasalized <i>i</i> or <i>u</i>. The cause of this deficiency is very
simple. A nasalized vowel requires a free passage for
the air from the pharynx to the nose; but this is rendered
almost impossible in the formation of <i>i</i>, where the tongue
is raised so high as to send most of the air through the
mouth however much depressed the <i>velum</i> may be, as
well as in the formation of <i>u</i>, where the tongue is pushed
backward towards the soft palate itself. A nasal <i>i</i>, however,
occurs in Portuguese, and probably also in the
Sanskrit <i>simha</i>, “lion.”</p>

<p>Every vowel-sound, then, demands three main conditions
for its production—the exspiration of air from the
lungs, the vibration of the vocal chords, and the formation
of a chamber of resonance by the organs of speech.
The three conditions must co-exist if we are to have a
simple vowel of definite quality, though the exspiration of
air need not last beyond the moment at which the vowel-sound
is formed. But the position of the organs of articulation
both before and after its formation occasions
important differences in the manner in which it is introduced
or ceases to be heard. In quick and lively utterance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the energy with which the stream of air is emitted
makes it difficult for each exspiration to be exactly
simultaneous with the corresponding vibration of the
vocal chords, while if the exspiration is weak, the
vocal chords are apt for a moment not to vibrate. In
order to give the chords on the one side the resisting
power requisite in energetic exspiration, and on
the other side to make them vibrate without delay in
weak exspiration, the windpipe must be contracted
for a second, thus checking the outflow of breath and
causing the chords to vibrate in unison. The sonant
breath so produced is the <i>spiritus lenis</i> of our old school-grammars,
the slight noise produced by the check given
in the throat to the uprush of air from the lungs. The
noise may easily be detected in whispering, or in the
pronunciation of a word like <i>’ear</i>, when a special effort is
made to prevent it from degenerating into <i>year</i>, and the
fact that it is a noise will explain the dislike felt by the
sensitive Greek to what the grammarians term a <i>hiatus</i>.
The <i>spiritus lenis</i> varies according as it is the result of a
compression of the <i>chordæ vocales</i> alone, or of the false
<i>chordæ vocales</i> as well; but it is doubtful whether we can
treat it as a distinct consonant and not rather as the pure
tone of the voice. Perhaps it should most strictly be
called a glide. It readily passes into the non-sonant
aspirate or <i>spiritus asper</i>, by allowing the breath to pass
through the throat without check or hindrance. The
glottis, indeed, is in the latter case slightly narrowed
and the larynx stiffened, but the difference between the
rough and soft aspirates is that the one is a continuous
sound, the other a checked breath. The vocal chords<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
are brought together while the breath is passing through
the throat, and since their movement may be either
quick or gradual the hard aspirate or <i>h</i> may correspondingly
vary in character. As Czermak first pointed out,
the more usual hard aspirate is that produced by the
gradual compression of the vocal chords when they
remain for a moment in a given contracted position.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The same causes which produce the <i>spiritus lenis</i> or
the <i>spiritus asper</i> at the beginning of the vowel-sound
produce similar results at its end. It may terminate with
a weak breathing, a firm breathing, or a non-sonant
aspirate. In the case of a weak breathing the exspiration
either ceases before the vocal chords have begun to vibrate,
thus resulting in a long vowel, or at the very moment
at which the windpipe is opened to admit the passage
of air, the result being a short vowel. The weak
breathing answers to what may be called the neutral
vocalic utterance, so rarely heard in language, when the
vowel-sound is introduced without either the soft or hard
aspirate, the windpipe being merely narrowed sufficiently
to set the vocal chords in motion at the same moment
that the exspiration takes place. The firm breathing corresponds
with the <i>spiritus lenis</i>, and is due to a sudden
check given to the vibrating voice. Examples of it occur
in words like <i>no!</i> <i>bah!</i> uttered abruptly, or where we
wish to divide two similar vowels one from the other.
The non-sonant aspirate is produced by continuing the
exspiration for a while after the opening of the windpipe,
and may be heard in final vowels which are at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
short and strongly accented. The non-sonant aspirate
is sometimes combined with the firm breathing, especially
in Danish, where such words as <i>ti</i>, <i>nei</i>, are pronounced
with a double exspiratory effort, the second consisting of a
non-sonant breath of more or less strength, jerked up, as
it were, after the vowel.</p>

<p>Now, let us stop for a moment to remind ourselves of
the distinction between sonant and non-sonant. Non-sonant
or surd sounds (also called “hard” and “breathed”)
are breath as modified by the organs of speech; sonants,
“soft” or “voiced” sounds, are voice similarly modified,
voice being breath when played upon by the vibrating
<i>chordæ vocales</i> in its passage through the partially closed
glottis. Voice, therefore, continues to be heard without
interruption as long as we have a succession of sonants
following one upon the other; the transition or “glide”
from one sonant to another consisting simply in the
change of position assumed by the organs of speech. In
pronouncing the sound <i>al</i>, all that happens in passing from
<i>a</i> to <i>l</i> is a transference of the tongue from the position required
for forming <i>a</i> to the position required for forming
<i>l</i>; voice continues without interruption. Now it is clear
that while voice is passing from <i>a</i> to <i>l</i>, neither pure <i>a</i> nor
pure <i>l</i> can be sounded, though the time occupied by its
passage (that is, by the change in the position of the
tongue) is so infinitesimally small that the sound or
sounds actually produced cannot be heard, and all we can
be conscious of is a modification of <i>a</i> at its end or of <i>l</i> at
its beginning. If we have two successive vowels, each
belonging to a different syllable, a separate effort of exspiration
is needed for both, and the transition-sounds are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
apt to escape notice from the weakening of the exspiration
during the interval between the two efforts; but if
the vowels do not belong to distinct syllables, the result
is wholly different. Diphthongs, as we term them, consist
in the combination of two simple vowels, usually
short, into a single syllable pronounced, therefore, with a
single exspiratory effort, and with the stronger accent on
the first vowel. The sound we hear is produced while the
organs of speech are being changed from the position required
for the one vowel to the position required for the
other. We have only to sing the diphthongs <i>ai</i> or <i>au</i> on
a long note to hear a distinct <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> at the end of each,
and the Sanskrit grammarians discovered more than
two thousand years ago that the diphthongs <i>ê</i> and <i>ô</i> were
really combinations of <i>a</i> + <i>i</i> and <i>a</i> + <i>u</i>. The primary
condition of the existence of a diphthong is the rapid transition
from one of the component vowels to the other, and
this renders the true resolution of a diphthongal sound so
extremely difficult except to the specially trained ear.
Once acquainted with the two component vowels, we can
easily determine the intermediate or transition sounds in
which the diphthong really consists; but written documents
rarely do acquaint us accurately with them. Diphthongs
whose second element is <i>e</i> or <i>o</i> have sometimes
been termed “imperfect” and considered of younger
origin than those whose second element is <i>i</i> or <i>u</i>, because
of their greater fulness of tone and consequent inappropriateness
to the unaccented place in the compound; but
such a view does not seem to be correct. It appears
certain, however, that languages show a tendency to form
diphthongs the longer they live and the greater the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
extent to which they have been affected by phonetic decay.
English is a prominent example of this tendency;
our vowels are all becoming diphthongs; even the first
personal pronoun <i>I</i> (<i>ai</i>) has become one, and already we
hear <i>aither</i> and <i>naither</i> more frequently than <i>either</i>
(<i>eether</i>) and <i>neither</i>. The so-called long vowels which
occur in such words as <i>say</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>he</i>, are all diphthongal,
and some of the local dialects have carried the tendency
even further than the literary language.</p>

<p>The existence of triphthongs has been disputed, and
no doubt most of the alleged cases, such as <i>iei</i> or <i>ieu</i> in
the Romance idioms, are either dissyllables or consist of
a semi-vowel followed by a diphthong. But, as Sievers
remarks:<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> “the transition from the first to the second
component element of a diphthong may be so prolonged
that even the transition sounds themselves may be distinctly
heard.” As for semi-vowels, they differ from the
first element of a diphthong only in having lost the
accent and being followed by a strongly accented vowel.
Hence they come to assume the function of sonant consonants.
Hence, too, the necessity that the vowels in
which they originate should possess less fulness of tone
than the vowels by which they are immediately followed.
We may have <i>yá</i> and <i>wá</i>, but hardly <i>ᵃᵢ</i> and <i>ᵃᵤ</i>.
Naturally <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> most readily pass into semi-vowels,
partly from their comparatively weak tone, partly from
the compression of the air-passage needed to produce
them, partly from the similar position of the organs of
speech in forming the spirants <i>y</i> and <i>w</i>. These spirants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
as we shall see, are not to be confounded with the semi-vowels
<i>y</i> and <i>w</i>.</p>

<p>A vowel, then, is the quality or timbre of voice as
modified by the tongue and lips, and consists of the
forms assumed by the vibrating air as it passes through
the windpipe and vocal chords. But the tongue and
lips naturally tend towards the same position whatever
be the vowel sounded. A man who has been accustomed
to give his tongue a particular position in pronouncing
<i>i</i> will give it much the same position in pronouncing
<i>e</i>, for we must never forget that there is an
almost infinite number of <i>i</i>’s or <i>e</i>’s varying with the
slight changes of position of the tongue and lips when
placed for enunciating those vowels. According to the
greater or less use made of the lips in speaking will be
the character of all the vowel-sounds of a language. The
vowels, consequently, fall into systems, and in investigating
the phonology of a dialect, we have to inquire
not only what vowels it possesses, but more particularly
what system these fall into. The basis of English
vowel pronunciation is the passive position of the lips,
just as in the Holstein dialect it is the withdrawal and
flattening of the tongue. Sievers states, that in speaking
the dialect of Lower Hesse the tongue must be relaxed
and in a position of the slightest possible tension; while,
on the contrary, in the Saxon dialects the whole tongue
must be tense, the throat stiffened and the exspiration
energetic. “Hence the hard, somewhat screaming impression
made by this dialect in contrast with the dull,
almost heavy and negative character of the Hessian.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>But it is time to turn from the vowels to the consonants,
the skeleton, as it were, of articulate utterance. A
language could consist wholly of vowels; indeed, a
Polynesian dictionary contains numbers of words which
have not a single consonant in them, and children frequently
mark the differences between words rather by
the vowels than by the consonants they contain. The
earliest systems of writing other than ideographic are
syllabaries and not alphabets, while alphabets like the
Sanskrit ascribe an “inherent” vowel to each of their
consonants. But though vowels are indispensable to an
organized language, it by no means follows that they
were equally indispensable to the first attempts at speech.
As a matter of fact, a preponderance of vowels such as
characterizes the Polynesian dialects is a sign of phonetic
decay and linguistic old age. “Consonants,” says Professor
Max Müller, “are much more apt to be dropped
than to sprout up between two vowels.” If we had only the
Greek μέρμερος or the Latin <i>memor</i> before us, we should
have no idea that they have lost an initial sibilant; in
fact, this only becomes apparent when we compare the
Sanskrit <i>smar</i>, “to remember.” The endeavour sometimes
made to reduce the Parent-Aryan alphabet to a
small number of simple and easily pronounced consonants,
is founded on the fallacy that the results of a
phonetic analysis of the words we utter and a reduction
of the sounds they contain into their leading types, is
identical with the primitive alphabet of the Aryan race.
On the contrary, the sounds of a language become more
simplified and clearly marked the longer it continues to
be spoken, and the primitive Aryan alphabet, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
being a simple list of primary sounds, from which all
that are harsh or indistinct have been carefully eliminated,
must really have resembled the existing alphabets of
barbarous or semi-barbarous tribes, and included a large
variety of consonants, many of which we should find it
extremely difficult to reproduce.</p>

<p>Consonants may be divided, in the first place, into
hard and soft, or, as they are more usually termed, surd
and sonant. A surd consonant consists of checked breath,
a sonant consonant of checked voice. If, in the second
place, either breath or voice is completely checked in
its passage through the organs of speech, an explosive
or momentary (also called a stopped or mute) consonant
is heard at the moment the check is removed; if the
check is not complete, and the organs of speech only
approximate so that the breath cannot escape without
friction, a fricative (spirant, “unstopped”) or continuous
consonant is the result. Where a spirant or fricative is
immediately preceded by an explosive, a double sound
or affricative is the result (<i>e.g.</i> German <i>pf</i>, Armenian <i>t’š</i>);
where the spirant follows the explosive we have the
aspirated letters, which will be spoken of hereafter.
Among the continuous consonants must be ranked the
nasals, produced by dropping the uvula and so allowing
some of the breath to make its way to the nostrils through
the pharynx, and the trills produced by the vibration of
the uvula, the lips, or more commonly the tongue. Distinct
from the nasals and the trills are the central continuous
consonants (<i>h</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>y</i>, English <i>r</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>wh</i>, and the
sibilants) formed by lifting the centre and point of the
tongue to the centre and front of the palate, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
lateral continuous consonants (<i>l</i>, and, according to Bell,
English <i>th</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>), in forming which the breath is allowed
to escape along the edges of the tongue. A further cross
division will be into liquids, gutturals, dentals, palatals,
labio-dentals, and labials, to which may be added the
linguals or cacuminals (cerebrals) of Sanskrit.</p>

<p><i>The Liquids.</i>—Among the liquids should properly be
reckoned only those kinds of <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> which stand to the
spirant <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> in the same relation that the vowel <i>i</i>
stands to the spirant <i>y</i>. In forming the vowels, as we
have seen, the tongue assumes a dorsal position, that is,
some part of its back is raised towards the palate; in
forming the liquids, on the other hand, the tongue has
either an oral (central) or a lateral position, the liquid <i>r</i>
requiring the articulation of the centre and tip, the liquid
<i>l</i> that of the sides. But there are several kinds of <i>r</i>,
which may be classed as cacuminal, spirant, alveolar or
dental, uvular or guttural, and laryngeal. The cacuminal
<i>r</i> is the purest liquid <i>r</i> that we hear, inasmuch as it
is wholly untrilled, and is especially common in cultivated
English. In order to produce it, the front surface of the
tongue is hollowed out into a spoon-like shape and
raised towards the hard palate behind the alveolar teeth-roots
of the upper jaw, while the edge of the tongue is
stiffened and kept free from any sort of vibration. It
will be clear from this how closely allied this cacuminal
<i>r</i> is to the vowels, and we can easily understand the
readiness with which it combines with a vowel-sound
when we remember that it may be formed in almost any
part of the hard palate, while the lips have free play
during its creation. Corresponding to the cacuminal <i>r</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
the spirant (or “buzzed”) <i>r</i>, which also occurs plentifully
in English as in such words as <i>try</i> or <i>dry</i>. The
mouth is completely closed by the tongue when sounding
<i>t</i> or <i>d</i>, and if in passing to the position needed for <i>r</i>
the tongue is not removed from the palate quickly
enough, or the exspiration is not sufficiently strong, a
slight fricative sound like that of <i>sh</i> is produced which
results in the spirant <i>r</i>. As for the dental or alveolar <i>r</i>,
all that is requisite to produce it is to raise the front part
of the tongue, at the same time slightly arching its extreme
edges, and so obtaining a constricted or “squeezed”
chamber of resonance between the side of the tongue and
the alveolars. This <i>r</i> may be untrilled, but in German
it is more frequently a trilled one. The trill is caused by
the force of the exspiration which strikes the thin hollowed
edge of the tongue in an outward direction, the tongue
the moment after returning to its former position like a
piece of india-rubber. If the two edges of the front part
of the tongue be pressed against the teeth, the tip of the
tongue between them being alone allowed free play, and
accordingly vibrating in a very small and narrow space,
a sound is heard approaching that of <i>s</i> or <i>sh</i>. The
stronger the uprush of breath and the vibration it occasions,
the plainer will be the sibilated sound; indeed, a
genuine sibilant can even attach itself to the liquid, as in
the Polish <i>rz</i>. The uvular or guttural <i>r</i> is supposed by
Sievers to be a modern substitution for the trilled alveolar
<i>r</i>. At any rate it is produced by lifting the back of
the tongue to the soft palate and forming a deep groove
along the middle of it, in which the uvula can vibrate
freely. The groove, however, is frequently left wholly or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
nearly unformed, the consequence being a very grating
character acquired by the <i>r</i>, which then passes over into
the sonant guttural spirant heard in sounding the modern
Greek γ. The laryngeal <i>r</i> was first observed and described
by Brücke, who makes it arise from sinking the
voice so that the vocal chords cease to vibrate audibly,
and merely produce intermittent and explosive sounds.</p>

<p>Each kind of <i>l</i> is formed in the same way, by raising
the tip of the tongue and so closing the orifice of the
mouth, at the same time allowing the breath to pass
along the two sides of the tongue in successive oscillations
produced by the vibrations of the elastic edges
of the tongue. We may distinguish the cacuminal <i>l</i> in
which the tip of the tongue is bent backwards as in
the cacuminal <i>r</i>; the alveolar <i>l</i> with the edge of the
tongue laid against the alveolars; the dental or interdental
<i>l</i> in which the flattened surface of the tongue
fills up the space between the two sides of the mouth;
and the dorsal <i>l</i> (as in the Spanish <i>llano</i>) in which the tip
of the tongue presses against the lower incisors, while
the centre of the tongue is raised towards the alveolars
of the upper teeth. The best-known variety of the cacuminal
<i>l</i> is that of the Welsh <i>ll</i> formed by pressing the
flattened tip of the tongue against the gums of the upper
teeth and allowing the breath to escape on its right side.
The same sound is heard in the Icelandic <i>hl</i> and <i>l</i> before
a <i>t</i>, and also in Cheroki,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> though in Icelandic the tongue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
is pressed against both sides of the mouth. A half-sonant,
spirant <i>l</i> may be heard when the exspiration is
strong; a surd <i>l</i> often occurs at the end of a word or
after surd consonants (particularly <i>t</i> and <i>s</i>). The sound
of the <i>l</i> may be made clearer or obscurer by raising or
depressing the front part of the tongue, and so narrowing
or enlarging the space between its edges and the
teeth, and since the vowels may be pronounced with the
tip of the tongue on the palate, they may readily pass
into <i>l</i> by simply broadening the surface of the tongue.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the tongue is not the only
organ of speech which may be “trilled.” In the Arabic
<i>grhain</i> (غ), the Northumberland <i>burr</i> and the French
Provençal <i>r</i>, <i>grasseyé</i>, the uvula which lies along the back
of the tongue towards the teeth is very distinctly made to
vibrate. “If,” Mr. A. J. Ellis says, “the tongue is more
raised and the vibration indistinct or very slight, the
result is the English <i>r</i> in <i>more</i>, <i>poor</i>, while a still greater
elevation of the tongue produces the <i>r</i> heard after palatal
vowels, as <i>hear</i>, <i>mere</i>, <i>fire</i>. These trills are so vocal that
they form distinct syllables, as <i>surf</i>, <i>serf</i>, <i>fur</i>, <i>fir</i>, <i>virtue</i>,
<i>honour</i>, and are with difficulty separable from the vowels.”
The lips, too, may be trilled, the result being <i>brh</i>, a
sound constantly heard from children.</p>

<p><i>The Nasals.</i>—The characteristic of a nasal is, as the
name declares, the participation of the nose in producing
the sound. The breath passes through the nose rather
than through the mouth. Sometimes, however, all that
happens is the removal of the membrane which separates
the nasal orifice from the pharynx; this alone is indispensable
to the formation of a nasal letter. Hence its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
resemblance to a vowel, the buccal tube being alike silent
in both cases. If we try to converse when walking uphill
we shall find that the nasals are longest heard. These
nasals must be classified as labial, dental, palatal, and
guttural, according to the part of the speaking apparatus
in which the current of air is checked in its exit, and it
will be best to treat them along with the other sounds
formed in the same part. It should be noted, however,
that the so-called surd nasal which we hear in
<i>hm!</i> has really, as Sievers remarks, not the slightest
similarity to a nasal, but approximates to the aspirates
or breathings.</p>

<p>The traditional division of the consonants into labial,
dental, palatal, cerebral (cacuminal) and guttural, though
not scientifically precise, is yet too familiar to be disregarded,
and we shall therefore follow it so far as is possible.
We must, however, remember at starting the primary
distinction between the two classes of letters, called
variously hard and soft, tenues and mediæ, surds and
sonants, as well as between those called momentary (explosive)
and continuous or checks and fricatives. What
this distinction consists in has already been explained.</p>

<p><i>The Labials.</i>—The labials may be subdivided into pure
labials, with the formation of which the lips only have to
do, and the labio-dentals, in the formation of which the
teeth also participate. In pronouncing the surd <i>p</i>, the
sonant <i>b</i>, the nasalized <i>m</i>, or the middle German <i>w</i>, the
lips are either wholly or (as in <i>wh</i>) almost wholly closed.
<i>B</i> only differs from <i>p</i> in being pronounced with voice
instead of breath, the voice partly preceding, partly
following the check occasioned by the closure of the lips.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
As in all sonant letters, the exspiration is less forcible than
in the case of surd letters. The labio-dentals <i>f</i> and <i>v</i> are
merely modifications of the rough and soft aspirates by
pressing the lower lip against the upper teeth. When the
lips are brought together without any interference of the
teeth the <i>spiritus lenis</i> becomes the German <i>w</i> as heard
in a word like <i>Quelle</i>. Our <i>wh</i>, or rather <i>hw</i>, and <i>w</i> are
continuous sounds, the lips being slightly opened, the
back of the tongue raised, and the breath passing over
its central part.</p>

<p><i>The Dentals.</i>—The articulation needed for the dentals
is partly oral, partly alveolar, partly dorsal. The common
principle, however, involved in the formation of them all
is the same; the tongue must be brought against the
teeth. The so-called cerebral or cacuminal dentals of
Sanskrit and the Dravidian tongues (<i>ṭ</i>, <i>ḍ</i>, <i>ṭh</i>, <i>ḍh</i>) are due
to oral articulation, the tongue being made convex and the
lower surface raised towards the palate. The English <i>t</i>
and <i>d</i> are also said to be cerebral, though the tip of the
tongue is not bent very sharply backwards in forming
them. Alveolar articulation is needed for the dentals
when they have to be pronounced with the edge of the
flattened tongue pressed against the alveolars of the upper
teeth, while in dorsal articulation the point of the tongue
is simply turned back against the lower teeth, its convex
being at the same time lifted to the palate. It is in this
way that the Bohemian dorsal <i>t</i> is formed. The dorsal
dentals may be varied by raising the back of the tongue
nearer to the mouth or the throat, the tip either resting
behind the lower teeth or being raised to the upper alveolars.
Besides the surd dental <i>t</i> and sonant dental <i>d</i>, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
have also a series of dental spirants which bear the same
relation to <i>t</i> and <i>d</i> that <i>f</i> and <i>v</i> bear to <i>p</i> and <i>b</i>. By
slightly opening the teeth and stopping the aperture with
the extended edges of the tongue we produce the interdental
sounds heard in <i>breath</i> or <i>think</i> and <i>breathe</i> or
<i>then</i>. The first <i>th</i> (or <i>thorn</i> þ) differs from the second
(ð)<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> in being pronounced with the rough breathing instead
of the soft breathing. They stand midway between an
oral and a dorsal articulation. How readily they may
pass into the labio-dentals <i>f</i> and <i>v</i> is clear at a glance; we
have only to raise the lower lip a little and curl back the
tongue, and our <i>th</i> becomes an <i>f</i>. Equally readily, as we
shall see, is the passage from them to a sibilant. We
seldom meet with an interdental consonant; Sievers, however,
states that they exist in Servian and Armenian,
where they regularly represent the whole class of dentals.</p>

<p><i>The Palatals.</i>—The palatals come next. They stand
between the dentals and gutturals, and are formed by
throwing the middle of the tongue, raised as it were into
a hump, against that part of the roof of the mouth where
the hard palate begins. The sound (<i>ch</i>) heard in the
English <i>church</i> or the Italian <i>cielo</i> is now held to be, not
a palatal, but a dental (<i>t</i> followed by <i>sh</i>), and we must
go to the Sanskrit (<i>ch</i>) as still pronounced to find a type
of the whole palatal series. It “is formed most easily,”
says Professor Max Müller, “if we place the tongue and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
teeth in the position for the formation of <i>sh</i> in <i>sharp</i>, and
then stop the breath by complete contact between the
tongue and the back of the teeth.” It will be seen from
this that the true <i>ch</i> is not a double letter, a compound
of <i>t</i> and <i>sh</i> or <i>s</i>, but a single consonant which ought
to be denoted by a single character. The Sanskrit
palatal <i>ch</i> may have had the same pronunciation as the
Armenian <i>t‘ sh</i>,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> as Sievers thinks, or it may have been
equivalent to <i>ky</i>. However this may be, it is plain from
the great extent of the “chamber of resonance” in which
the palatals are formed—the whole of the hard palate
being available for the purpose—that a large number of
palatal sounds is possible. They may range, in fact, from
<i>ky</i> to <i>tsh</i>. The guttural <i>k</i> passes easily enough into the
palatalized <i>ky</i>, as may be seen from the pronunciation of
<i>kind</i> and <i>cow</i> as <i>kyind</i> and <i>kyow</i>, not unfrequently heard
in English; indeed, all that is requisite for the transition
is for the front part of the tongue to assume the position
needed for <i>y</i>, while the back part is in that needed for <i>k</i>.
In the northern dialects of Jutland <i>j</i> is heard after <i>k</i> and
<i>g</i> when followed by <i>œ</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>ö</i>. The German “soft”
guttural aspirate or palatal spirant in words like <i>ich</i>, <i>licht</i>,
is the result of the <i>spiritus asper</i> passing the middle of the
tongue when raised against the hard palate, <i>y</i> in <i>you</i> or
<i>yet</i> being due to a softening of the breath, the organs of
speech remaining unchanged. The palatal sibilants will
have to be considered separately.</p>

<p><i>The Gutturals.</i>—Putting aside the cerebrals, which
have been treated under the head of the dentals, we now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
come to the gutturals, usually an important class of
sounds in savage idioms. First of all we have the
tenuis <i>k</i>, produced by bringing the root of the tongue
against the soft palate, together with the deeper <i>k</i> heard
in the Semitic <i>koph</i> or Georgian <i>q</i>. Next is the media <i>g</i>,
to create which breath has to be changed into voice.
Then will come the guttural nasal <i>ng</i> (as in <i>sing</i>), and the
continuous <i>ch</i> and <i>g</i> heard in the German <i>nach</i> and <i>Tage</i>.
The sound heard in <i>nach</i> or the Scotch <i>loch</i> is formed by
raising the tongue against the soft palate or uvula, and
so checking the uprush of breath, its sonant representative
being the <i>g</i> of <i>Tage</i>. The result of only slightly
checking the uprush of breath in the latter case is the
passage of the guttural into a semi-vowel. This sonant <i>g</i>
is the γ of modern Greek; it sometimes takes the place
of the uvular <i>r</i>, though this office more properly belongs
to the sonant <i>g</i> of Armenian pronounced further back in
the mouth. The surd <i>ch</i> may be similarly modified by a
posterior pronunciation, and so become the Armenian <i>xe</i>,
the Russian <i>x</i>, the Polish <i>ch</i>, and the deep <i>ch</i> of the Swiss.</p>

<p><i>The Sibilants.</i>—The main division of sibilated sounds is
into the surd <i>s</i> and <i>sh</i>, and the sonant <i>z</i> and <i>j</i>. When the
centre and tip of the tongue are raised to the centre and
front of the palate, the breath or <i>spiritus asper</i> is modified
into <i>s</i> (as in <i>sin</i>), the voice or <i>spiritus lenis</i> into <i>z</i> (as in
<i>zeal</i> or <i>rise</i>). When the tongue is turned back with its
lower surface against the alveolars of the upper teeth,
less of the palate being covered than is required for <i>s</i> and
<i>z</i>, breath becomes <i>sh</i> (as in <i>sharp</i>), voice <i>j</i> (as in <i>azure</i>,
<i>pleasure</i>, French <i>jamais</i>). The ordinary German <i>s</i> is a
dorsal one, the current of air being allowed to pass between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
the upper alveolars and the lower surface of the
uplifted tongue; in North German dialects, however, we
frequently meet with an alveolar <i>s</i>, formed in much the
same way as the alveolar <i>r</i>. The same <i>s</i> also occurs in
English, as well as a cacuminal <i>s</i> distinguished by a more
pronounced retraction of the tip of the tongue and narrower
space between it and the palate. The palatal <i>ś</i>,
found in Russian, for instance, before the weak vowels
(<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, &amp;c.), only differs from the dorsal <i>s</i> in the more retracted
position of the tongue. <i>Sh</i> (<i>j</i>) can be modified
in three ways. The channel formed in the tongue when
pronouncing <i>s</i> may be so diminished as to allow the
breath to strike against the lips, or the lips may form
with it an approximately rectangular aperture, or, thirdly,
the left (or more rarely the right) side of the tongue may
be pressed against the palate, causing the breath to strike
against the lips, which are generally raised a little on the
side. Sievers declares that he has sometimes heard this
unilateral <i>sh</i> in England. However this may be, all three
modifications of <i>sh</i> may combine with the dorsal, alveolar,
cacuminal, and palatal positions of the tongue to
produce the cacuminal <i>sh</i> of English (identical, probably,
with the Sanskrit <i>ś</i>), the palatal <i>mouillé</i> <i>ś</i> and <i>ć</i> of Polish
and Russian, the alveolar <i>sh</i> of the North German dialects,
and the dorsal <i>sh</i> of the Middle and Southern
German dialects. It is one of the many evils of our defective
and misleading mode of spelling that the surd <i>sh</i>,
though a single sound, is represented by two letters, and
so cannot be distinguished from the aspirated <i>sh</i> (as in
<i>gas-hole</i>), which is really a double sound.</p>

<p>These aspirated sounds consist, as we have seen, of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
explosive followed by a spirant, and they occupied an
important place in the older languages of our Aryan
family of speech. A large number of roots contain them,
and the Brahmans still pronounce each part of the compound
sound distinctly, <i>ph</i> and <i>th</i>, for instance, being
pronounced as in our <i>up-hill</i> and <i>ant-hill</i>. The compound
nature of the sound caused sometimes the one element in
it, sometimes the other, to fall away. Thus, to a Sanskrit
<i>tubhy(am)</i> corresponds a Latin <i>tibi</i>, and the Latin <i>mihi</i>
and Sanskrit <i>mahyam</i> presuppose an earlier <i>mabhyam</i>,
<i>mabhi</i>. The Athenian tendency to false aspiration which
has produced the initial aspirate of ὑδώρ (Latin <i>unda</i>, <i>udus</i>)
or ἵππος (Latin <i>equus</i>) has also occasionally affected the
labial tenuis. φῦσα and its kindred, for instance, answer
to the Latin <i>pustula</i>, the Lithuanian <i>pústi</i>, “to blow;”
ἄφνος is the Sanskrit <i>apnas</i>, the Latin <i>ops</i>, and κεφαλὴ is the
Sanskrit <i>kapâla</i>, the Latin <i>caput</i>. A curious metathesis
of the aspiration may take place in both Sanskrit and
Greek. In Sanskrit a final aspirated media before a
following tenuis loses its aspirate, which is transferred to
the initial of the root, provided that be <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>, or <i>b</i> (as <i>bhut-karoti</i>,
“he who knows acts,” for <i>budh-karoti</i>); and in
Greek we find θρίξ becoming τριχὸς, τρέχω becoming θρέξω.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that it is only the surd
explosives (or tenues) that properly can thus be combined
with the rough breathing (<i>h</i>). A difficulty occurs in the
case of the sonant explosives (or mediæ); and it is a
grave question whether we ought to transcribe <i>gha</i>, <i>dha</i>,
and <i>bha</i> by the side of <i>kha</i>, <i>tha</i>, and <i>pha</i>. In Greek, at
any rate, we have only aspirated tenues, and while τ’ followed
by an aspirate is written θ, this is never the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
with δ’. At the same time, the existence of aspirated
mediæ was recognized by the Prâtiśâkhyas by the side
of the aspirated tenues, and the accuracy of the Prâtiśâkhyas
is confirmed by the requirements of etymology.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the sibilants are the palatal
and guttural sounds, already noticed, heard in the German
<i>ich</i>, <i>tage</i>, and <i>acht</i>. The palatal <i>ch</i>, written χ by
Sievers, <i>jh</i> by Sweet; is of two kinds. What Sievers
calls χ,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> heard in the German <i>ich</i>, Icelandic <i>hjarta</i>, and
sometimes in such words as our <i>hue</i>, is formed on the
hard palate near the soft palate by the front part of the
tongue. On the other hand, χ,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> as in the Dutch <i>g</i> before <i>e</i>
and <i>i</i>, is formed in the hollow of the arch. The guttural
sonant heard in the North German <i>tage</i>, or the modern
Greek γ, is formed between the back of the tongue and
the middle of the soft palate, the tongue being lifted up
towards the front of the mouth. As already remarked, it
sometimes represents the uvular <i>r</i>; thus, Mr. Sweet says,
“when the passage (of the voice) is widened so as to remove
all buzzing, the sound of (<i>gh</i>)<a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> no longer suggests
(<i>kh</i>)<a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> or (<i>g</i>), but rather a weak (<i>r</i>) sound.” Further back
in the mouth is formed the Armenian sonant <i>g</i>, corresponding
to χ.<a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The <i>ch</i> of <i>acht</i>, again, may be divided into
two varieties. <i>Ch</i>,<a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> formed, as stated above, between the
back of the tongue and the middle of the soft palate, is
the guttural spirant usual in German after <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>,
and heard in Scotch <i>loch</i>. Further back is formed <i>ch</i>,<a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
common in Swiss and other South German dialects. We
have also <i>ch</i>,<a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> noted by Mr. Sweet in Scotch after <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
formed between the back of the tongue and the place
where the hard palate begins. It thus comes very
near χ.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Distinct from the exspiratory sounds, whether vowels or
consonants, which have now been passed in review, are
sounds formed either by inspiration or simply by the air
in the mouth itself. Winteler<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> describes certain Swiss
dialects which make use of inspiratory sounds to disguise
the voice, and the clicks characteristic of the South
African languages are examples of sounds produced
without either taking in or emitting breath. The Kafirs
have borrowed the three easiest clicks (the dental, the
cerebral, and the lateral) from their Hottentot neighbours,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
and there are reasons for thinking that the Hottentots
themselves borrowed in turn from the more
primitive Bushmen. At all events, the labial and compound
dental clicks are wanting in Hottentot, and the
Bushman fables put what Dr. Bleck calls “a most unpronounceable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
click,” which does not occur otherwise in any
of the dialects, into the mouth of the hare, the anteater,
and the moon.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> These inarticulate clicks, thus adapted to
the purposes of articulate speech, bridge over the gulf
between the latter and the cries of animals, and we may
see in them a survival of those primæval utterances out
of which language was born. Traces of what may thus
be termed the germs of language on its phonetic side are
met with here and there all over the globe. Thus Haldeman
describes at least three clicks heard in Texan,
Chinook, and other North American languages, <i>t</i> in the
Anadahhas of Texas, for instance, being followed by
“an effect as loud as spitting.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> According to Klaproth,
clicks occur in Circassian; and Bleek states that two
clicks are distinguished in the ǀikhe language of Guatemala—one
somewhat resembling the Hottentot dental
click, and the other the Hottentot palatal combined with
some guttural. Mr. Whitmee has heard a click in certain
dialects spoken by the Negritos of Melanesia. Clicks
are also known among the Gallas; and Miss Lloyd has
found a little boy from Lake Ngami using clicks resembling
those of Nama Hottentot. Clicks are formed by
placing the tongue or lips in the position required by an
explosive, and then sucking out the air between the
organs thus brought into play, the result being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
“cluck” or “smack” with which grooms are accustomed
to encourage a horse, but in combination with the explosive
for which the organs of speech were set. According
to Mr. Sweet, the labial click is an ordinary kiss; the
dental click, “the interjection of impatience ordinarily
written ‘tut.’”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> In Káfir the clicks are not pure, as in
Bushman—that is to say, they are always accompanied
by an exspiratory consonant, which is formed at the same
moment as the click. This affords an additional reason
for thinking that the Káfir clicks are not survivals from
the original condition of speech, but loans from another
people, which have been attached by way of ornament to
the existing exspiratory sounds of the language. Of the
same nature as the clicks are the implosives peculiar to
Saxon German, where no distinction is made between <i>d</i>
and <i>t</i>, or <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>. Similar sounds are heard in Georgian
and the Armenian of Tiflis, and they must have characterized
ancient Accadian, since no distinction is made in
writing between final <i>d</i> and <i>t</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>k</i>, or <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>. These
implosives are due to compression of the air between the
closed glottis and the organs of speech when in position
for an explosive, by forcing the glottis upwards. No
sound is emitted until the sound is fully formed, when
the final or transition sound is curiously modified.</p>

<p>We have hitherto dealt with the individual sounds in
the same fashion as the lexicographer deals with individual
words. But just as a word is really but one of the
elements of a sentence, and to be thoroughly understood
must be treated as such, individual sounds are but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
elements of which syllables are composed. Whatever
may be the nature of a sound when regarded apart and
by itself, it is necessarily much modified when combined
in actual speech with other sounds. The syllable, and
not the single sound, is the starting-point of phonetic
utterance.</p>

<p>A syllable must contain either a vowel or a semi-vowel,
by which are meant such inspiratory utterances as that
heard in the interjection <i>’m</i>, or the vocalic <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> of
Slavonic and other tongues. One of the first achievements
of the phonograph has been to show that an open
syllable like <i>ga</i> can be pronounced either backwards or
forwards indifferently when once the organs of speech
are in position; and not only so, but that when the waves
of air set in motion by the pronunciation of a word are
reversed, the word will be reproduced backwards—<i>əsoshiéshun</i>
(<i>association</i>), for instance, becoming <i>nushéshiosə</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Sweet has pointed out that syllables are divided
by the stress. Speech has to be carried on by a succession
of exspirations or puffs of breath, and naturally the
force with which the breath is emitted gradually diminishes
during the continuance of the exspiration. Only in
special cases—the interjections, for example—the force
increases instead of diminishing. When the exspiration
is spent, and a new breath is taken, a new syllable begins.
Wherever, therefore, the stress is laid we must place
the beginning of a new syllable. In “a name” the stress
is on the nasal, where accordingly the syllable begins; in
“an aim” it is, on the contrary, on the diphthong.</p>

<p>The passage from one sound to another, as has already
been noticed, consists of a series of infinitesimal intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
sounds, corresponding with the series of positions
assumed by the vocal organs in passing from one position
to another. These intermediate sounds have been
conveniently termed “glides” by Mr. Ellis, and they
play an important part in the formation of syllables.
Glides are of two kinds, as the organs of speech may
either be moved from one position to another in the
shortest possible time, or be shifted, on the way, towards
another position needed for the production of a third
sound. Thus, in the syllable <i>ki</i> we have the immediate
glide required for the transition from <i>k</i> to <i>i</i>; in the syllable
<i>qui</i>, the indirect glide from <i>k</i> to <i>i</i> through the position
needed for <i>u</i>. A glide may, of course, be described
as either initial or final; in <i>ki</i>, the glide of <i>k</i> is being final,
that of <i>i</i> initial. Some of the so-called consonants and
vowels are really glides. The neutral vowel (<i>ə</i>) is termed
the “voice-glide” by Mr. Sweet, as “produced by emitting
voice during the passage to or from a consonant.”
It may begin a word, as in “against,” and in English
is very frequently replaced by a liquid, as in the words
“little,” “possible.” It is also found plentifully in the
Semitic languages, the Hebrew <i>sh’wa</i>, for instance, being
simply the neutral vowel or voice-glide. In words like
“follow,” when pronounced rapidly, we may hear it
labialized. A diphthong, again, is a combination of a
full vowel with a glide-vowel either before or after it,
though the glide-vowels may be prolonged into full
vowels without destroying the diphthong, by equalizing
the stress upon the two elements of which it is made up.
These glide-vowels (like the consonantal glides) are produced
by putting the vocal organs into position for pronouncing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
a particular vowel, but not letting voice sound
until this position is being shifted to that required by the
full vowel which forms the second part of the compound,
and reversing the process when the full vowel forms the
first part. Consonantal glides (<i>y</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>) are illustrated
by the sound of <i>y</i> in <i>you</i>, and of <i>r</i> in <i>here</i>, and in a
common South-country pronunciation of words like <i>red</i>.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
According to Mr. Sweet, the aspirate <i>h</i> is a consonant
in the glottis, but “a voiceless glide-vowel in the
mouth.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>At all events it is often difficult to distinguish the rough
breathing from the glide which easily develops into it
by the help of a little additional stress. This glide may
be detected after mediæ, tenues, and <i>s</i>, whether initial or
final, as in our <i>cold</i> (when pronounced emphatically), <i>pack</i>,
and <i>big</i>. The Irish and Danish aspirated consonants are
formed by laying a separate stress on the glide apart from
the stress laid upon the preceding consonant. The aspirated
letters of Greek and Sanskrit, described above, are
of course different, as here we have a combination of two
independent sounds, though the latter of these (<i>h</i>) is in
Mr. Sweet’s eyes a mere glide-vowel in the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>Glides may be absent where two consonants formed in
the same part of the vocal organs are united together (e.g.
<i>and</i>, <i>its</i>), or even where they are formed in different parts.
This is especially the case with English. Wherever
homorganic sounds are produced, the vocal organs pass at
once from the position required for the first to that required
for the second, without first falling back into the
“position of indifference.” Where an explosive is followed
by a nasal, a sudden opening of the <i>velum pendulum</i>
is substituted for the usual “explosion,” as first
pointed out by Kudelka.</p>

<p>Syllables may differ one from the other in respect of
<i>pitch</i> or <i>tone</i>, of <i>stress</i>, and of <i>quantity</i>. Pitch or tone is
but little noticed by Englishmen, since with us it serves
merely a logical or emotional purpose, such as the expression
of surprise or the asking of a question, but in some
languages, Chinese or Swedish or Lithuanian, for example,
every word has its own separate tone, which
helps to distinguish it from other words. This, too, was
the case in Vedic Sanskrit, and in ancient Greek and
Latin, what we call the Greek accents being really
the marks of the pitch at which words were pronounced.
Pitch or tone depends on the rapidity of the vibrations of
sound, and may be either rising, level, or falling. The
rising tone is that indicated by the acute accent. Tone
may also be compound, marked in Greek by the circumflex.
The compound or circumflex is heard when the
tone of a vowel is again raised after it has already passed
the moment of its greatest intensity, and it may therefore
be described as composed of the acute and the grave,
or of the rising and the falling. It may be noticed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
Lithuanian as well as in several German dialects, such as
the Thuringian, which have a singing character, and when
it falls upon a diphthong the second element of the
diphthong is distinctly raised in pitch. Naturally it is
usually found with diphthongs and long vowels, but short
vowels combined with a liquid may also carry the circumflex.
In Greek it commonly implies a contraction, the
circumflex resulting from the coalescence of a vowel
which has the acute accent with one which has the
grave.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The Vedic system of accentuation best exhibits the
fundamental character of accent of pitch. The <i>udâtta</i> or
acute denotes the highest pitch reached by the voice in a
group of syllables or words. In the syllable immediately
preceding the voice naturally sinks to its lowest, thus
producing the <i>anudâtta</i>, or grave tone. After the <i>udâtta</i>,
however, the voice falls gradually; consequently the
syllable which follows has the <i>swarita</i> or circumflex
accent, and it is only the next syllable to that which is
again <i>anudâtta</i>.</p>

<p>But the tone is regulated by three different conditions,
which sometimes act antagonistically. It may be either
a syllable-tone, determined by the relative force with
which the syllables of a word can be uttered, dependent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
on the nature of the sounds of which they are composed;
or a word-tone, determined in great measure by the
meaning, and serving to distinguish words from one another;
or a sentence-tone, mostly determined by logic or
the feelings. The Greek accents, like the Vedic ones,
were used to denote all three varieties of tone; while the
acute and the circumflex sometimes represent the syllable-accent
(as in θῖνα, ἔτυπον), sometimes the word-accent
(as in νυμφή, νύμφα, ποδῶν), the grave, as Sievers remarks,
“is a concession to the requirements of the sentence-tone.”
Similarly in Vedic Sanskrit, the <i>udâtta</i> which ordinarily
indicates the word-accent, falling as it does upon the
syllable (commonly the flection) to which the signification
caused the attention to be chiefly directed, seems
also to have indicated the sentence-tone, since the verb
of the principal clause has no accent whatever attached
to it. Previously, however, both in Greek and Sanskrit
the accents denoted the word-tone, and the remarkable
agreement between the accentuation of the two languages
enables us to restore in great measure the accentuation
of the undivided parent-speech. It cannot be an accident,
for instance, which makes the numeral seven (<i>saptán</i>,
ἑπτά) oxyton in both languages, and the numeral five
(<i>pánchan</i>, πέντε) paroxyton, or places the acute accent on
the last syllable of adjectives in -<i>us</i>; the accentuation in
each instance must have been that of the Parent-Aryan.
Where the accentuation of the two languages differs, it
can generally be explained by the disturbing influence of
analogy. Thus while there is so remarkable an agreement
between the accentuation of Vedic and Greek nouns,
there is next to none between that of the verbs. But an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
explanation of this is forthcoming. The verb of the
principal clause in the Veda loses its accent, as has just
been remarked, unless it stand at the beginning of the
sentence; in fact, it is regarded as an enclitic, and throws
its tone back upon the preceding word however many
syllables it may contain. Now in Greek a rule gradually
grew up forbidding the accent to be placed further back
than the antepenultimate; the accent, accordingly,
which in the case of verbal forms of more than two syllables
would have been on the last syllable of the preceding
word in the Veda fell on the penultima of the corresponding
verbal form itself in Greek. The accentuation
which thus fixed itself in the verb of the principal clause
was extended by analogy to the verb of the subordinate
clause, and eventually to verbal forms of less than three
syllables; φημι, εἰμι, and ἐστι, however, remained unaccented
to bear witness to the process whereby the Greek language
had changed the original accentuation of the
Aryan verb.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> This, like the accentuation of the noun,
was mostly (and probably at the outset altogether) on the
flection-suffix to which it called attention, and thus marked
out the symbols that expressed the grammatical relations
of the sentence. In the Semitic languages, on the
contrary, the primitive accentuation was on the penultima,
though there may possibly have been an earlier
time when it was upon the ultima.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The tendency to
throw back the accent set in early in Aryan speech; in
Latin, as in the Æolic dialect of Greece, it was uniformly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
as near the beginning of a word as possible, and the preservation
of the original pitch-accent in Lithuanian is one
of the most curious marks of archaism in that most conservative
of West-Aryan tongues.</p>

<p>In Aryan the word-tone, we have seen, was primarily
used in the service of grammar. In Chinese, Siamese,
and other Taic languages, however, its use is lexical
rather than grammatical; here it serves to distinguish
the senses of words which would otherwise be pronounced
in the same way. Dr. Edkins has shown that modern
Mandarin Chinese is an exceedingly decayed speech; its
initial consonants have been worn away; and all its final
consonants reduced to the same monotonous nasal. To
prevent the confusion that would thus have been occasioned
in a monosyllabic language, where the possible
number of different syllables denoting words was limited
even before the corroding action of phonetic decay,
tones were adapted to the expression of meaning, and
as old letters disappeared new tones came into existence.
To create a new tone, says Dr. Edkins, requires about
1,200 years.</p>

<p>The sentence-tone is inseparable from speech even of
the most lifeless character. Each sentence has its own
key, and the several parts of it their own pitch. The tone
rises when we ask a question, it falls when we answer it,
it reaches the “level” point of neutrality when we speak
in monotone. But there are dialects and languages in
which monotone is either acute or grave. “Thus in
Scotch the rising tone is often employed monotonously,
not only in questions but also in answers and statements
of facts. In Glasgow Scotch the falling tone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
predominates.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> In French, too, the rising tone is often used in
making statements of fact.</p>

<p>Quite distinct from accent of pitch is accent of stress,
though the close connection between the two may be
gathered from the fact that in modern Greek the stress
accent regularly answers to the acute and circumflex of
the ancient language. Much of this regularity, however,
may be due to the same pedantic revival which has resuscitated
the dialect of Plato and Thucydides and substituted
it for the “modern Greek” spoken half a century
ago. Stress is the force with which the different syllables
of words are uttered, and increased force is naturally accompanied
by increased pitch. Stress, in fact, corresponds
to syllable-tone and word-tone, emphasis—the
stress of a sentence—corresponding to sentence-tone. Like
pitch, it may be regarded as either rising, level, or falling.
Stress, however, differs from pitch in its variability; there
is no gradual fall, but a tendency “to sway to and fro,”
as Mr. Sweet expresses it. Rising stress may consequently
be of varying degrees of force and falling stress
of weakness, level stress, even in French, being practically
unknown. Stress and pitch together give to speech its
rhythmic character, and make it the lyric utterance in
which man expresses his thoughts and his emotions.
Where the rhythm is regular we have poetry and song,
where it is irregular the language of ordinary prose. Stress
is the great conservator of language; the chief counterpoise
to the action of phonetic decay. The accented
syllable will be preserved though all the other syllables<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
by which it is surrounded may disappear in pronunciation,
just as the idea upon which emphasis is laid will
hold out successfully against the attacks of age and forgetfulness.
Winteler<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> has laid down the law that in
accented syllables, liquids, nasals, and spirants are always
long after a short vowel if followed by a consonant (e.g.
<i>man̄ly</i>, Germ. <i>al̄t.</i>)</p>

<p>The loss of the accent of pitch in modern English and
the consequent extension of the accent of stress have
made us less observant of <i>quantity</i> than the grammarians
of India or the poets of ancient Greece. All
syllables, however, may be classed as long, half-long, or
short, due to the duration of the force with which they
are uttered. According to Brücke, the duration needed
for the production of a long vowel is to that needed for
the production of short vowels in the proportion of five
to three, but Sievers remarks that this only applies to
the oratorical pronunciation of modern literary German.
In any case, the length of the same vowel may vary
according to circumstances; it is long, for instance, in
the English <i>sīz</i> (<i>seize</i>), short in <i>sĭs</i> (<i>cease</i>). Several of the
Scotch dialects possess no long vowels at all, while in
French most vowels are half-long, distinctly short
accented vowels being final, as in <i>oui</i>.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Like vowels,
consonants, too, may be long or short. In our own
language final consonants are long after short vowels (as
<i>hill</i>), short after long vowels (as <i>heel</i>), and <i>l</i> and the
nasals are lengthened before sonants (as <i>build</i>), shortened
before surds (as <i>built</i>). Short final consonants after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
short vowels make the pronunciation appear clipped, as
in German words like <i>mann</i>.</p>

<p>Accent has considerable influence upon quantity. On
the one side short vowels may be lengthened and pure
vowels converted into diphthongs by the accent falling
upon them. This is partly the origin of the Sanskrit
<i>guṇa</i> and <i>vṛiddhi</i>, according to which a simple <i>ă</i> is raised
to <i>â</i>, an <i>ĭ</i> to <i>ê</i> (<i>ai</i>) and <i>ai</i> (<i>âi</i>), and an <i>u</i> to <i>o</i> (<i>au</i>) and <i>au</i>
(<i>âu</i>).<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The lengthening of short vowels in Hebrew in a
“pause,” that is at the end of a sentence, is another
example. In the German dialects monosyllables which
end in a consonant frequently have their vowel changed
into a diphthong by the accent, the original vowel appearing
again as soon as an additional syllable is added.
In our own English the short vowel of a monosyllable
which ends in a sonant frequently becomes half-long
when accented (compare <i>fog</i> with <i>fóggy</i>, <i>god</i> with <i>góddess</i>).
On the other side, the absence of the accent may bring with
it a diminution of quantity. Thus a diphthong may be
shortened by being pronounced in the same period of
time as is required for the pronunciation of a short
vowel, or may even be reduced to the short vowel which
lies midway between the two elements of which the
diphthong consists. A short vowel, again, may be
reduced to a vocalic consonant like the Slavonic <i>r</i>. Since
much movement of the lips in speaking implies an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
energetic enunciation, shortened syllables are naturally
pronounced with passive lips. To this fact we must
ascribe the numerous short syllables of modern cultivated
English.</p>

<p>There is but little difference between a long or
“strong” consonant and a doubled one. In the first
case, the position of the vocal organs for pronouncing
the consonant is retained with gradually decreasing
force, until it is suddenly shifted to the position needed
for the following vowel; in the second case it is shifted
back again, when the force required to produce it is half
spent. Strictly speaking, therefore, the consonant cannot
be said to be doubled; there is simply a break or pause
in the utterance of it, the force necessary to produce it
being renewed before it has been fully exhausted. In
English, French, German, or Slavonic the double consonants
have become long ones; to find them still pronounced
we must turn to Italian, Swedish, Finnic, or
Magyàr. Analogous to a double consonant is the combination
of a sonant with a surd, when assimilation does
not take place, as in <i>has to do</i> or <i>has seen</i>. In Sanskrit
and Greek aspirated letters could not be doubled, Sanskrit
permitting only <i>kkh</i>, <i>tth</i>, and <i>pph</i>, and Greek only
κχ, τθ, and πφ; hence it seems plain that there was either
no glide or a glide practically inaudible.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the combination of a consonant and
a vowel admits of an almost infinite series of variations
according as the formation of the one or other sound is
made prominent in pronunciation. The consonant may,
as it were, swallow up the vowel; on the other hand, the
vocal organs may be shifted to form the vowel while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
they are still in the act of forming the consonant. Hence
arise <i>mouillé</i> and labialized letters. If the front part of
the tongue be raised and the lips opened while a consonant
is being uttered, a palatalized or <i>mouillé</i> letter is
the result, of which the Italian <i>gl</i> and <i>gn</i>, the Spanish <i>ll</i>
and <i>ñ</i>, or the Portuguese <i>lh</i> and <i>nh</i>, may be regarded as
examples. Still better examples, according to Sievers,
are combinations of consonants with an original <i>i</i> in
many Slavonic languages (<i>e.g.</i> Russian <i>nikto</i>). Certain
consonants are incapable of being <i>mouillé</i>; gutturals, for
instance, in whose formation the back part of the tongue
plays so prominent a part can only be so by becoming
palatals. Labialized sounds are those in which the lips
are rounded while the pronunciation of a consonant is in
process. Labials and gutturals show the same fondness
for this labialization or “rounding,” that the palatals and
dentals do for mouillation; and a comparison of the
derived languages proves that the primitive Aryan speech
must have possessed a row of labialized or “velar” gutturals—<i>kw</i>,
<i>gw</i>, <i>ghw</i>—of which the Latin <i>qu</i> and our own
<i>cw</i>, <i>qu</i> are descendants. There is nothing to show that
these velar gutturals were ever developed out of the
simple gutturals; so far back as we can go in the
history of Indo-European speech the two classes of
guttural exist side by side, and the groups of words
containing them remain unallied and unmixed. Γυνή and
<i>queen</i> (<i>quean</i>) must be separated from γένος, <i>genitrix</i>, <i>kinder</i>,
and other derivations of the root which we have in the
Sanskrit <i>janâmi</i>, the Greek γίγνομαι, γείνομαι, and the Latin
<i>gigno</i>; and the labialized <i>quies</i> can have nothing to do
with the Greek κεῖμαι and κώμη (κύμη), our own <i>home</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
<i>ham-let</i>.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Both rounding and mouillation may be combined,
as in the Danish <i>kyst</i>, <i>pynte</i>, and when occurring
at the end of a word may frequently be explained from
the analogy of cases in which the word is followed by a
syllable beginning with <i>u</i> and <i>i</i>. Such an explanation,
however, is more likely to be true of mouillation than of
rounding; indeed, an <i>i</i> or <i>y</i> sound is very apt to develop
itself after consonants in affected pronunciation, as in the
English <i>kyind</i>, <i>duke</i> (for <i>dook</i>), or the Greek ζορκάς (δyορκας)
for δορκάς and the Magyàr <i>ágy</i>, “bed.” Conversely a
palatal <i>i</i> or <i>y</i> may develop a dental sonant before it:
thus the Italian <i>diacere</i> comes from the Latin <i>jacere</i>, the
Low Latin <i>madius</i> from <i>majus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and the Greek ζειά (δyειά)
and ζυγόν (δyυγόν) from <i>yava</i> and <i>jugum</i> (Sansk. <i>yugam</i>).
In these instances we may trace the influence of emphasis;
the parasitic letter is due to the attempt to speak with
greater distinctness and solemnity.</p>

<p>But whether it be emphasis or the other two causes of
change described in an earlier chapter, the pronunciation
of sounds, like the meaning they convey, is in a constant
state of flux. Nowhere is the dogma of Herakleitus,
πάντα ῥεῖ, truer than in the history of speech. No two people
pronounce exactly alike, nor does the same person always
pronounce the same word or group of words in exactly the
same way. Apart from the changes undergone by the
pronunciation of words according to the sounds of the other
words with which they may be associated, it is difficult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
to pronounce the same word when uttered singly twice
in precisely the same way. The very effort to do so
produces modification of the sound. Such shades of
difference in utterance, however, are imperceptible to any
but an unusually sensitive ear; it is only when the difference
becomes considerable that it attracts notice. It
then constitutes what we may term a variety, and such
varieties we may hear sometimes from the lips of a single
individual, sometimes from the members of a family,
sometimes from those who live in daily contact and under
the same conditions of life. The faculty of imitation is
strong within us, and a particular pronunciation once
started soon spreads, as it were instinctively, amongst
those who are much together. It has often been observed
how like the members of a family are to each other, not
only in general appearance and manner, but still more in
the use of similar expressions and idioms and the pronunciation
of sounds. It is the same with schools, and
to a less degree with universities to which the students
come with their habits of phonetic utterance more or
less formed: it has been said that the handwriting
betrays the school at which the man has been educated;
it may be said with equal justice that the mode of
speaking does so too. In a savage state of existence,
where tribe-life and village-life are on the one hand strict
and intense, and the husband on the other hand sees
but little of his wife and children, the conditions favourable
to the growth of varieties in pronunciation are more
numerous than among civilized men. The language of
the nursery becomes in time the language of the tribe.</p>

<p>This phonetic variety may be broadly stated as mainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
due to differences in the structure of the vocal organs.
Putting aside imitation and analogy, putting aside, too,
all wilful and conscious changes of pronunciation such as
those enumerated on page 205, a particular sound or a
particular way of pronouncing a sound may be easier to
one speaker than to another. Very slight differences in
the physical formation of the organs of speech may produce
the most important consequences. And when a
habit of pronunciation has once been fixed, it is difficult
to alter it. The child who is learning to speak will as
readily learn Chinese as English, the Japanese <i>r</i> as the
Northumberland <i>burr</i>; it is quite another matter when
the attempt to catch the sounds of a new language has
to be made in adult years.</p>

<p>Climate and food have, doubtless, an important effect
in producing changes in the formation of the vocal
organs; but at present we have no means of knowing
the nature and extent of their influence. Professor
March remarks of the change of <i>i</i> to <i>g</i> in Anglo-Saxon,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
that “the movement (of consonants to vowels) is sometimes
reversed, as when a nation moves northward, or
northern peoples mix with a vowel-speaking race.”
The Rev. W. Webster has drawn attention to the nasal
twang which distinguishes not only American English,
but American Spanish, Portuguese, and French as well;
and which seems to be due to the dryness and the extremes
of the American climate, while he further suggests
climatic influences for the origin of the loss of the
aspirate in Spanish words like <i>hijo</i>, pronounced <i>ijo</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
Latin <i>filius</i>, which in the fourteenth century still had
<i>f</i>, and for the intensification of the aspirate in the corresponding
Gascon words. We are all well acquainted
with the hoarseness and roughness that exposure to the
atmosphere lends to the voice, and the exercise and
strength that a mountainous region gives to the lungs
produce their effect in the vigour with which sounds are
uttered. In cold countries the respiration is accelerated,
while the air being denser contains a larger volume of
oxygen.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The prognathism of the lower and older races
of men, again, must have considerably modified their
powers of utterance. “The lower jaw,” says Dr. Rolleston,
“which in every well-marked variety of the human
species contributes very importantly towards the making
up of its distinctive character, was in the brachycephalous
Briton usually a very different bone from the lower
jaw of his Silurian predecessor.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The strange fashions,
too, which lead the savage to mutilate and deform his
person, have frequently a very direct bearing upon phonology.
Thus the loss and confusion of the labials and
the excessive nasalization in the languages of the natives
of the Pacific coast of America must be traced to the
rings that are worn through the nostrils and lips of the
people.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The Otyi-herero of South Africa is lisping in
consequence of the custom of knocking out the four
lower teeth, and partly filing off the upper front ones, to
which also Professor Max Müller suggests the occurrence
of the English, <i>th</i> and <i>dh</i> in the language may be due,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
and the Dinkas, who, like all the negroes of the White
River, extract the front teeth of the lower jaw, have no
sibilants.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be the causes which bring about varieties
in pronunciation, certain it is that they are as continually
making their appearance as varieties in the realm of
natural history. Where they are unrestrained by the
conservative tendencies of literature and education, they
soon spread from the individual and the household and
become species or dialects. The dialect itself may in
course of time assume so marked a character of its own,
and be so widely spoken as to be accounted a separate
language; and will stand to the varieties and species
destined to grow out of it in the relation of a genus to
its species. But with this further development phonology
has little to do.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with the changes which result in the rise of
a new dialect. Comparative philology is based on the recognition
that the same word will be represented by different
combinations of sounds in a group of allied dialects or
languages, and that each combination will be governed
by a fixed phonetic law. An English <i>h</i>, for example,
will answer to a Greek and Latin <i>k</i>, an English <i>t</i> to a
German <i>z</i> and a Sanskrit <i>d</i>. When once a sound is given
in a language, we may know the sounds which must
correspond to it in the cognate languages. Now and
then, of course, subordinate laws will interfere with the
working of the general law; but unless such an interference
can be proved, we must never disregard the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
general law for the sake of an etymological comparison,
however tempting. To compare the Greek θεός with the
Latin <i>deus</i> and the Sanskrit <i>devas</i>, rests upon almost as
unstable a foundation as the old derivation of <i>whole</i> from
ὅλος, and <i>call</i> from καλέω.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> We must never forget that the
laws of phonology are as undeviating in their action as
the laws of physical science, and where the spelling does
not mislead us will display themselves in every word of
genuine growth. Even the vowels cannot be changed
and shifted arbitrarily; they, too, follow definite laws of
development, and though it is not yet possible to state their
equivalence in the several languages of a single family
with the same precision as in the case of the consonants,
we may feel quite sure that this is the fault of our ignorance
and not of the facts themselves.</p>

<p>It was the great Grimm who, following in the wake of
Rask, first formulated the empiric law of that regular
<i>Lautverschiebung</i>, or shifting of sounds, in our Indo-European
family of speech which has since gone under
his name. Since his time the law has been the subject of
much discussion and examination;<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> his statements have
been amended and amplified, and an endeavour made to
apply the same law to the vowels that has been applied
to the consonants. The following table<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> exhibits the
equivalence of sounds in the Aryan family of speech:—</p>

<p>Some of the changes of sound recorded in the above
table are as old as the undivided Aryan speech itself.
They go back to the dialects that existed in the earliest
period of which our materials allow us to know. Instead
of clinging, with Fick, to a genealogical tree, and deriving
the Aryan languages of Europe and Asia from two
parent-stems, Western and Eastern Aryan, and these
again from a single <i>Ursprache</i> or primitive speech, it is
better to follow J. Schmidt in tracing the later languages
to co-existent dialects, which by the loss or absorption of
intermediate dialects and the migration of the speakers became
more and more distinct and divergent one from the
other. It is, of course, quite possible that the speakers of
the most western of these dialects moved across the Ural
range into Europe in a compact body, and there settled
for a while in a district westward of a line drawn from
Königsberg to the Crimea, where the beech grew, and
that it was from this second home of the Aryan race that
the waves of European emigrants successively broke off.
Certainly Professor Fick seems to have shown the common
possession of certain phonetic peculiarities, such as
the vowel <i>e</i>, by the Western as distinguished from the
Eastern Aryans, and the Eastern or Indic branch of the
family clearly once formed a single whole which subsequently
divided into Iranian and Hindu. Unfortunately
the position of Armenian and the allied dialects
is still a matter of doubt; and there are scholars who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
would regard them as a link between the European and
the Asiatic sections of the Aryan group. But Fick
labours hard, and apparently with success, to prove that
the Aryan dialects of Asia Minor, such as we know them
from glosses and inscriptions, belonged to the European,
not the Asiatic section, while Armenian, on the other
side, is an Iranian tongue. Fick’s conclusion is confirmed
by the evidence of the cuneiform inscriptions. Up to the
eighth century B.C. Armenia was still inhabited by tribes
who spoke non-Aryan languages, and it was only a
century previously that the Medes had first forced their
way into the country regarded by the agglutinative Accadians
as the cradle of their race, but which was afterwards
to be the seat of the Aryan Medes. Eastward of
the Halys there was nothing Aryan until long after the
occupation of Armenia by the new-comers.</p>

<p>We have certain proof that the series of changes which
resulted in the formation of High German took place
subsequently to the overthrow of the Roman Empire.
Latin words for instance like (<i>via</i>) <i>strata</i> or <i>campus</i>,
adopted by the Teutons during the era of their wars with
Rome, are found in both Low and High German in the
very forms which the application of Grimm’s law would
require them to have were they native words. Thus <i>strata</i>,
Low German <i>strata</i>, our <i>street</i>, becomes <i>straza</i> in Old
High German, <i>campus</i>, our <i>camp</i>, similarly becomes <i>kamph</i>,
<i>kampf</i>. The Hessians were called Catti in Roman times,
and though now High Germans, had the same ancestors
as the Batavi, from whom the modern Dutch draw their
descent, while the Malbergian glosses show the language
of the Franks to have been Low German, although the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
Franconians of to-day, who are descended from the same
stock as the Suabians and Ripuarians, speak High German.
Here, at any rate, we have an instance of a series
of varieties finally resulting in a new language in historical
times.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that all the changes of pronunciation
that serve to distinguish one branch of the
Aryan stock from another took place simultaneously.
On the contrary, they were slow and gradual; first one
and then another new fashion in sounding words sprang
up and became general: when once the new pronunciation
had, from any cause, taken a firm hold of the community,
analogy caused every word to be submitted to its
influence, unless special reasons, such as accent, stood in
the way, until in course of time the process of shifting
the sounds was completed. An instructive illustration of
this shifting of sounds has lately been going on almost
under our eyes. In the Samoan Islands of the Pacific
only fifteen years ago <i>k</i> was an unknown sound except
in one small island of the group, where it replaced <i>t</i>.
Since then it has practically disappeared from all of
them, and <i>t</i> has taken its place. What makes the
rapidity of the change the more extraordinary is that the
speakers of the language live on separate islands, and
that intercourse between them is less intimate now, according
to Mr. Whitmee, than it was in the days of heathenism.
And yet in spite of books and schools, in
spite of education and every effort to check it, the change
has come about. The natives will ridicule the foreigner
who pronounces in the new fashion, they will themselves
take pains to sound the <i>k</i> when reading aloud or making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
a set speech, but in conversation it has ceased to be
heard. The tendency to put <i>k</i> for <i>t</i> seems to be irresistible;
it is in the air, like an epidemic, and the spelling,
so recently introduced, no longer represents the common
pronunciation of the people.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>We must be on our guard against thinking that the
sounds represented by the same letter of the alphabet in
different languages are really identical. We have seen
of what numberless variations each sound that we utter is
capable, and it does not follow that because the Sanskrit <i>cha</i>
and the English <i>church</i> are written with the same palatal
<i>ch</i>, that therefore they are to be pronounced alike. And
what is true of the consonants is still more true of the
vowels. There is much to show that the European scale
of three short vowels—<i>ă</i>, <i>ĕ</i>, <i>ŏ</i>—is more primitive than the
Indic single vowel <i>ă</i>, in which three distinct vowel-sounds
of the parent-speech have coalesced, but we cannot infer
from this that the three vowel-sounds of the parent-speech
were actually <i>ă</i>, <i>ĕ</i>, and <i>ŏ</i>. Indeed, when we remember
that the Greek ἕκατον (for ἕν-καντον) corresponds to the
Latin <i>centum</i>, while <i>ferentis</i> is represented by φέροντος, it is
quite clear that the Latin <i>ĕ</i> must have developed out of
one or more sounds which were distinct from it. In
dealing with the hypothetical Parent-Aryan it is best,
with Brugman, to symbolize these three primitive vowels
as <i>a</i>¹, <i>a</i>², and <i>a</i>³.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> It is possible that some at least of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
earlier sounds out of which more than one articulate sound
have afterwards developed, were of a vague indeterminate
character, not properly-formed vowel utterances. Professor
Max Müller<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> quotes authorities to prove that in the
Sandwich Islands <i>k</i> and <i>t</i> are undistinguished, and that
“it takes months of patient labour to teach a Hawaian
youth the difference between <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>d</i>, <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
The confusion between <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>, however, has already
been explained by the similar fact observed in Samoan
where the sound has actually changed within the last
fifteen years, a distinctly-articulated <i>k</i> becoming an
equally distinctly-articulated <i>t</i>. But even in English we
find people saying <i>a cleast</i> instead of <i>at least</i>, while at
Paris and elsewhere the lower classes say <i>amikié</i> for
<i>amitié</i>, <i>charkier</i> for <i>charretier</i>, <i>crapu</i> for <i>trapu</i>.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> So in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
the old Paris argot <i>j’équions</i> stood for <i>j’étais</i>, and in
Canada the uneducated part of the population says
<i>mékier</i> for <i>métier</i>, <i>moikié</i> for <i>moitié</i>. Bleek, again, writes
of the Setshuana dialects: “One is justified to consider
<i>r</i> in these dialects as a sort of floating letter, and
rather intermediate between <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>, than a decided <i>r</i>
sound.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> To these instances of confusion between two
consonants which Professor Max Müller believes to be
“a characteristic of the lower stages of human speech,”
may be added the fluctuation between two forms of the
same sound in the North German dialects, where no distinction
is made between surd and sonant <i>mediæ</i>, as well
as in many of the Armenian dialects.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> But we must bear
in mind that this childlike inability to distinguish between
sounds may be due to two very different causes. It may
be a result either of the sound being formed at the neutral
point, as it were, intermediate between two distinct sounds,
or of the ear being unable to discriminate between different
articulations. The latter cause is analogous to
colour-blindness, and has most to do with the imperfections
of childish utterance or the substitution of <i>r</i> for <i>l</i> so
often heard; the other cause is of a purely phonetic
character, and takes us back to the time when man was
gradually fashioning the elements of articulate speech.
This infantile state of language had probably been long
left behind by the cultivated speakers of the Parent-Aryan;
indeed, the very existence of the three vowels marked
<i>a</i>₁, <i>a</i>₂, and <i>a</i>₃, would imply that such was the fact. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
there was any confusion in the pronunciation of their
words it would have to be ascribed rather to sound-blindness
than to imperfection of utterance.</p>

<p>The regular action of Grimm’s law may be interfered
with by the influence of other laws, just as in physical
science the regular action of the law of attraction may be
interfered with from time to time. Foremost among these
disturbing agencies is the accent. K. Verner has shown<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
that the position of the accent has occasioned that apparent
disregard of Grimm’s law in the Teutonic languages
which has produced <i>mutter</i> and <i>vater</i> (O. H. G.
<i>muotar</i> and <i>fatar</i>) by the side of <i>bruder</i> (O. H. G. <i>brôpar</i>),
<i>sieben</i> (Goth. <i>sibun</i>) by the side of <i>fünf</i> (Anglo-Saxon
<i>fîf</i>), <i>schwieger</i> (O. H. G. <i>swigar</i> = ἑκυρὰ, <i>so-cru-s</i>) by the
side of <i>heil</i> (Greek καλός), or such a curious change in
the conjugation of the same verb as the Anglo-Saxon
<i>lîðe</i>,“I sail,” but <i>liden</i>, “sailed.” The same cause has
brought about the varying representation of an original
<i>ſ</i> now by <i>s</i>, and now by <i>z</i> or <i>r</i>. In the Veda, <i>bhrâtar</i> is
accented on the first syllable, like the Greek φράτηρ, <i>mâtár</i>
and <i>pitár</i> on the last, again like the Greek μητήρ and πατήρ.
<i>Sieben</i> answers to the Vedic <i>saptán</i>, the Greek ἑπτά,
whereas <i>fünf</i> is the Vedic <i>pánchan</i> and Greek πέντε.
<i>Schwieger</i> similarly goes back to the Vedic <i>´swa´srû´</i>,
Greek ἑκυρά, just as the O. H. G. <i>snura</i> from <i>snuza</i> goes
back to the Vedic <i>snushâ´</i>, Greek νυός, in contradistinction
to <i>nase</i>, <i>nose</i>, the Vedic <i>nâ´sa</i>, the Lithuanian <i>nósis</i>.
If we turn to the verb, we find that in Anglo-Saxon,
whereas the present <i>lîðe</i>, “(I) sail,” corresponds with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
Vedic <i>bhédâmi</i>, and the singular of the past tense <i>lâð</i>
with a Vedic <i>bibhéda</i>, the plural of the preterite <i>lidon</i>
corresponds with a Vedic <i>bibhidús</i>.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>There are other influences besides that of the accent
which may change and mar the face of words. Although
every change takes place in strict accordance with phonetic
laws, and is consequently capable of explanation,
the occurrence of the changes is more or less sporadic and
arbitrary. That is to say, they may act upon one word
and not upon its neighbour. In <i>should</i> or <i>would</i>, for instance,
<i>l</i> has been assimilated to <i>d</i>, but in <i>fold</i> and <i>cold</i> it
still maintains its existence. Such changes may be either
independent or dependent on the action of surrounding
sounds. The diversification of the Teutonic <i>a</i> into <i>e</i> and
<i>o</i>, or the transition of the Latin <i>ĭ</i> and <i>ŭ</i> into Romanic <i>e</i>
and <i>o</i> are instances of independent change. So, too, the
modern English pronunciation of the vowels with passive
lips, and the consequent loss of the intermediate vowels
<i>ü</i> and <i>ö</i>, is another example of the same facts. Wherever,
indeed, these intermediate vowel-sounds exist, we may
feel sure that the lips take an active part in articulation.
In all these cases the change happens in the formation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
the sound, uninfluenced by the neighbourhood of other
sounds. The extension of a simple vowel into a diphthong
may also be brought under this head, though the
presence of the circumflex accent seems to have much to
do with it. On the other hand, changes in the dentals,
the passage of <i>z</i> into <i>r</i> and <i>r</i> into <i>l</i>, or the transition from
a guttural to a palatal and a dental, are all examples of
purely independent change. When we find an Aryan <i>kw</i>
(<i>k</i>²) and <i>gw</i> becoming <i>ch</i> and <i>j</i> in Sanskrit or τ in Greek, we
merely see the gradual forward movement of the tongue,
which is moved with less exertion towards its tip than
towards its root. The change of Aryan <i>kw</i> and <i>gw</i> into
<i>p</i> and <i>b</i> in Greek (as in πίσυρες and βίος<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>) is held by Sievers
to be due to a sudden “leap” in the articulation, <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>
partially assimilating the second part of each compound
into <i>p</i> and <i>b</i>, and then falling away altogether.</p>

<p>Most of the changes recorded in Grimm’s law may
be brought under the head of independent change. No
doubt the transition of <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>b</i>, into <i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>p</i> in German
is partially dependent upon the accent, but the growth
of an aspirate out of a <i>tenuis</i>, as exemplified in the
Irish pronunciation of English, is probably due to nothing
but an increase in the energy and duration with
which our breath is expired. The want of the stress
accent brings about the shortening and loss of final
vowels, the tonic accent, on the other hand, tending to
lengthen them.</p>

<p>The changes caused by the action of one sound upon
another may be divided into those which are due to assimilation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
and those that are not. In either case the time
occupied in pronouncing the changed sound remains the
same as it was before; it is only in cases of independent
change that it may differ. Assimilation is effected in
one of two ways. The relative positions of the vocal
organs needed for the pronunciation of two sounds may
be made to approximate, as in the reduction of <i>ai</i> (<i>a</i> + <i>i</i>)
to <i>e</i>, or the time that elapses between the pronunciation
of two sounds may be reduced or destroyed altogether, as
when <i>supmus</i> becomes <i>summus</i>. Where the change is not
due to assimilation, it will be found to depend on an
alteration in the time needed for the formation of two or
more sounds.</p>

<p>Assimilation may be regressive, progressive, or reciprocal.
Regressive assimilation is where a sound is assimilated
to that which follows it, as in ἕννυμι for ϝεσ-νυμι, from
the root <i>vas</i>, or ποσσί, for ποδ-σι (ποδ-σϝ-ι), and γράμμα for
γράφ-μα(τ). Progressive assimilation is the converse of
this, as in στέλλω for στελ-yω, μᾶλλον for μαλ-ιον, <i>mellis</i> for
<i>melv-is</i>, or the Æolic ἔστελλα for ἔστελ-σα. Regressive
assimilation largely preponderates in our Aryan languages,
progressive assimilation in the Ural-Altaic ones;
and it is very possible that Sievers is right<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> in tracing this
contrast to the difference of the accentuation, which in
Ural-Altaic falls upon the first syllable of the word, while
in the parent-Aryan it fell for the most part on the final
syllable. Böhtlingk<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> says, very appositely: “An Indo-Germanic
word is a real whole of such a kind that the
speaker has uttered the whole word, as it were, in spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
as soon as he has pronounced the first syllable. Only in
this way can it be explained how a syllable (or sound) is
modified in order to assist the pronunciation of the
syllable (or sound) that follows it. A member of the
Ural-Altaic race forces out the first syllable of a word—that
part of it, namely, which has the accent—little caring
for the fortune of the rest; on this he next strings in more
or less rude fashion a few more significant syllables, only
thinking of a remedy at the moment when he first feels
the want of one.” As for reciprocal assimilation, an example
of it may be found in the reduction of <i>ai</i> to <i>e</i> quoted
above, where both sounds influence one another.</p>

<p>Assimilation may be either complete or partial. There
are sounds which can never be thoroughly assimilated to
each other, <i>bn</i>, for instance, can never at once become <i>nn</i>,
only <i>mn</i>. Partial regressive assimilation meets us very
frequently in the classical languages; <i>e.g.</i>, λεκ-τός from the
root λεγε, ἤνυσμαι from ἀνυτ-, δόγμα from δοκ-; partial progressive
assimilation is rarer; e.g., πάσχω for πάσκω from
παθ-σκω.</p>

<p>The changes dependent on the presence of a second
sound, which are not due to assimilation, are necessarily
produced by varying the time needed for pronunciation.
Of these the most striking is metathesis. Metathesis must
be referred rather to a mental than to a phonetic origin.
Our thought and will outstrip our pronunciation, the
result being that the sound which ought to follow is made
to precede, or else the vocal organs are shaped prematurely
for the formation of a sound which ought to be
heard later, the consequence being that the sound which
should come first has to come last. Metathesis, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
is similar to the rapidity, or rather relaxation, of thought
which leads us sometimes to write or speak a word which
belongs to a subsequent part of the sentence; and it may
be of two kinds: either the place of two sounds may be
simply inverted, or the second sound may be made to
precede the first by two or three syllables. How easily
the first case can happen is shown by the phonograph,
where each syllable that has been uttered can be reproduced
backward by merely turning the handle of the
machine the wrong way. <i>R</i> and <i>l</i> are the most subject
to metathesis, then the nasals; the other consonants vary
according to their relationship to the vowels. More
regular than metathesis are the insertion and omission of
consonants, as in ἀν-δ-ρὸς, ἄ-μ-β-ροτος, τέτυφθε for τέτυφσθε,
<i>rêmus</i> for <i>resmus</i>. Somewhat different are the insertion
and omission of vowels, the first of which goes under the
technical name of <i>Swarabhakti</i>. This name was imported
from the Hindu grammarians by Johannes Schmidt,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> to
mark the growth of a short or reduced vowel from a liquid
or nasal, when accompanied by another consonant. Thus
<i>ănman</i>, “name,” became <i>ănă-man</i>, and then, by the loss
of the first vowel and the compensatory lengthening of
the second, <i>nômen</i> and <i>nâmâ</i>. <i>Swarabhakti</i> is, however,
incompatible with the acute accent. We may find examples
of it in the slow pronunciation which in English
turns <i>umbrella</i> into <i>umbĕrella</i>, and <i>Henry</i> into <i>Henĕry</i>.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
Prosthesis, or prothesis, the insertion of a short vowel
at the beginning of a word before two consonants, is
another illustration of <i>Swarabhakti</i>. There are many
nations which find a difficulty in pronouncing two consonants
at the beginning of a word. Thus the Bengali
calls the English <i>school</i> <i>yschool</i>, the Arab says <i>Iflatún</i>
for <i>Platon</i>, and the Ossete uses <i>a</i> for the same purpose.
In other cases, one of the consonants is dropped altogether,
as so frequently by children and systematically by
the natives of Polynesia. In Latin inscriptions and MSS.
later than the fourth century we find forms like <i>istatuam</i>,
<i>ispirito</i>, just as in the Romanic tongues we have <i>estar</i> and
<i>espée</i> (<i>épée</i>) for <i>stare</i> and <i>spada</i>, or in Welsh <i>ysgol</i> from
<i>schola</i>, <i>yspryd</i> from <i>spiritus</i>. According to Wentrup,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> <i>a</i>
is often used as a prothetic vowel in Sicilian; Lithuanian
has forms like <i>iszkadà</i>, German “<i>schade</i>,” and Basque
and Hungarian prefix a similar aid to the pronunciation.
No trace of a prothetic vowel can be found in Latin; in
Greek, however, such vowels are very plentiful. Thus we
have ἄσταχυς by the side of στάχυς, ἐχθές by the side of χθές,
ἰγνύη by the side of γόνυ, Ὀβριαρευς by the side of Βριαρεύς. In
Greek, too, as in other languages where prothesis occurs,
the complementary vowel may be inserted before a liquid,
more especially <i>r</i>, as well as before a strictly double consonant,
<i>e.g.</i>, ἀμύνω by the side of μύνη, ἐρυθρός by the side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
<i>ruber</i>, ὀρέγω by the side of <i>rego</i>. Even the digamma may
perhaps take the prefix as in the Homeric ἔεδνον. But it
is probable that no other single consonant does so, the
apparent exceptions being really explained by the loss of
a consonant which once existed along with the one that
is left. Ὀκέλλω, for instance, presupposes ὀ-κϝέλλω (Latin
<i>pellere</i>), Ἀπόλλων presupposes Α-κϝολιων, “the son of the
revolving one” (Sanskrit <i>char</i>, Greek πέλομαι). In other
cases we are dealing not with a prothetic vowel, but with
a part of the primitive root: ὄνομα, for example, is shown
by the Irish <i>aimn</i> and Old Prussian <i>emnes</i> to be more
original than the Sanskrit <i>nâmâ</i> or the Latin <i>nomen</i>, and
to stand for an earlier <i>an-man</i>; and ὄνυξ, the Latin <i>unguis</i>,
the Irish <i>inga</i>, is earlier in form than the Sanskrit <i>nakha</i>
and the English <i>nail</i> (<i>nagel</i>)<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>. We may discover a tendency
in Greek to adapt the prothetic vowel to that of
the root, though it is hardly so regular as in Zend roots
beginning with <i>r</i>, where we find <i>i-rith</i> for <i>rith</i>, but <i>u-rud</i>
for <i>rud</i>. Sanskrit, like Latin, shows an inclination rather
to drop initial vowels than to add them, but even in Sanskrit,
Curtius has pointed out<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> the Vedic <i>i-raj-yâmi</i> from
<i>raj</i> (<i>rego</i>) and <i>i-radh</i>, “to seek to obtain,” from <i>râdh</i>. As
for the loss of a vowel, it is too familiar to every one to
need any illustration.</p>

<p>More akin to metathesis is epenthesis, which closely
resembles the Teutonic <i>umlaut</i>. Epenthesis is especially
plentiful in Greek, where κτέν-yω becomes κτείνω, χερ-ιων
χείρων, λόγοσι λόγοις, ἐλαν-ϝω ἐλαύνω, νερϝον νεῦρον. Probably λέγει<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
for λεγειτ is to be explained as resulting from the epenthesis
of ι (λεγειτ for λεγετι), just as λέγεις stands for an earlier
λεγεσι. Epenthesis thus presupposes a mouillation or
labialization in which the articulation of the consonant
is absorbed, as it were, by that of the <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>. The greater
the participation of the lips and tongue in the formation
of these vowels, the greater will be the tendency towards
epenthesis.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have to consider the lengthening of vowels,
either by way of compensation or before certain consonants.
By compensation is meant the additional force
with which a vowel is pronounced after the loss of a consonant
which followed or preceded it. Thus in Greek
the loss of the digamma in βασιλεϝ-ος produced the Ionic
βασιλῆος on the one side and the Attic βασίλεως on the
other, just as the loss of the <i>yod</i> in πολιy-ος similarly produced
πολῆος and πόλεως. So, too, πάνς became πᾶς, δαιμονς
δαίμων, ἐφαν-σα ἔφηνα, <i>rĕs-mus</i> <i>rémus</i>, <i>pĕds</i> <i>pês</i>, <i>exăgmen</i>
<i>exâmen</i>, <i>măgior</i> <i>mâjor</i>. In certain cases the vowel was
raised into a diphthong, as in φέρουσι for φεροντι, τιθείς for
τιθενς, ἔστειλα for έστελσα. But a vowel may also be
lengthened before liquids, nasals, and spirants when combined
with another consonant. If the grave or the circumflex
accent fall upon the preceding vowel, the tendency
is to lengthen the vowel at the expense of the sonant or
spirant following. Hence it is, that whereas in our English
<i>tint</i>, or <i>hilt</i>, where the vowel has the acute, the nasal
and liquid are long; in <i>kind</i> and <i>mild</i>, on the other hand,
where the vowel is circumflexed, it is the vowel (or rather
the diphthong) that is long. The vowel, again, may be
lengthened to compensate for the loss of a double letter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
Thus in Latin we find <i>vīlicus</i> by the side of <i>villicus</i>, from
<i>villa</i>, and whereas the grammarians lay down that when
<i>ll</i> is followed by <i>i</i>, single <i>l</i> must be written, we find <i>millia</i>
in the famous inscription of Ancyra. So, too, the inscriptions
vary between <i>Amulius</i> and <i>Amullius</i>, <i>Polio</i> and
<i>Pollio</i>, and good MSS. have <i>loquella</i>, <i>medella</i>, instead of
<i>loquēla</i>, <i>medēla</i>.</p>

<p>There is another fact to be remembered when we are
looking for the application of Grimm’s law—a fact which
the law itself ought to bring to our minds. Different
languages have different phonetic tendencies; the same
sound is not equally affected by phonetic decay in two
different dialects or modified in the same way; each
language has phonetic laws and phænomena peculiar to
itself. Thus, in Greek, σ between two vowels is lost, in
Latin it becomes <i>r</i>; in Greek a nasal preserves, or perhaps
introduces, the vowel <i>a</i>, in Latin it prefers the
vowel <i>e</i>. Because τ between vowels becomes σ in Greek,
or <i>sr</i> in Latin is changed into <i>br</i> (as in <i>cerebrum</i> for <i>ceresrum</i>,
κέρας, <i>śiras</i>), we are not justified in expecting similar
changes in other tongues. In fact we have only to
look at the table of sound-changes, known as Grimm’s
law, to see that it is just because two languages do not
follow the same course of phonetic modification that a
scientific philology is possible.</p>

<p>To speak of Grimm’s law being “suspended,” of “exceptions
to Grimm’s law,” and the like, is only to show
an ignorance of the principles of comparative philology.
Grimm’s law is simply the statement of certain observed
phonetic facts, which happen invariably, <i>so far as we
know</i>, unless interfered with by other facts which, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
given conditions, equally happen invariably. The accidental
has little place in phonology, at all events in an
illiterate and uncultivated age. Literature and education
are no doubt disturbing forces: a writer may borrow a
word without modifying its sound according to rule; and
the word may be adopted into the common speech through
the agency of the schoolmaster; but such words are mere
aliens and strangers, never truly naturalized in their new
home, and the philologist must treat them as such.
Native words, as well as words which, though borrowed
from abroad, have been borrowed by the people and so
given a native stamp, undergo, and must undergo, all
those changes and shiftings of sound which meet us in
Grimm’s law, in the phonetic laws peculiar to individual
languages, or in any other of the generalizations under
which we sum up the phænomena of spoken utterance.
False analogy, it is true, may divert a word from the path
it would naturally have taken; one word may be assimilated
to another regardless of its real etymology, or
words whose real origin has been forgotten may be modified
so as to convey a new meaning to the speaker.
But, in such cases, the worst that could happen would be
the loss of the true etymology; Grimm’s law would
still hold good, and the originals of the existing sounds
would be those demanded by the regular <i>Lautverschiebung</i>.
So far as the present form of a word like <i>Shotover</i> (for
<i>château vert</i>) is concerned, it is to the mere phonologist,
as to the ordinary speaker, a compound of <i>shot</i> and <i>over</i>,
and in comparing these two words with allied words in
other languages the prescribed letter-change holds good.
It is only the comparative philologist, who has to deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
with the psychological as well as with the phonetic side
of language, that needs to know more, and to determine
that <i>Shotover</i> is not what it professes to be, but the product
of a more or less conscious imagination. In most
cases of analogy we have to do with mental as opposed
to phonetic assimilation, and they fall, therefore, under
sematology, the science of meanings, rather than under
phonology, the science of sounds. No doubt we find instances
of analogy, like the Greek accusative βεβαῶτα,
modelled after the nominative βεβαώς,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> or the Latin genitives
<i>diei</i>, <i>dierum</i>, modelled after the accusative <i>diem</i> for
<i>diam</i>, but such instances fall under the laws and conditions
of that phonetic assimilation which has been already
described. Let us hold fast to the fact that the generalizations,
the chief of which are summed up in the formula
known as Grimm’s law, are at once uniform and unvarying.
If an etymology is suggested, which violates these
generalizations, that etymology must be rejected, however
plausible or attractive. It is upon the fixed character of
these generalizations that the whole fabric of scientific
philology rests.</p>

<p>Necessarily similar generalizations may be made in
the case of other languages which, like the Aryan, can be
grouped into single families of speech; nay, they must
be made before we are justified in grouping them together,
or in comparing and explaining their grammar and vocabulary.
It is not always, however, that the changes of
sound are so marked and violent as in the Indo-European.
A group of allied languages may be as closely related to
one another as the modern Romanic dialects of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
and various causes may have combined to give a stability
and fixity to their phonology which has made it change
but slightly in the course of centuries. This is the case
with the Semitic dialects, whose laws of sound-change
are extremely simple. Practically the sound shiftings
are confined to the sibilants, where the equivalence of
sounds is as follows:—</p>

<table class="sounds">
  <tr>
    <th>Assyrian.</th>

    <td><i>z</i>, <i>d</i><a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>One or two other general laws of phonetic change may
be laid down for special members of the Semitic group;
thus, in Assyrian, <i>s</i> before a dental becomes <i>l</i>, and <i>kh</i> is
dropped when it answers to the Arabic and Ethiopic
weak <i>kh</i>. In the Babylonian dialect, again, <i>k</i> took the
place of <i>g</i>, and the <i>n</i> of the other dialects is sometimes
replaced by <i>r</i> in Aramaic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span></p>

<p>But the Semitic idioms are dialects rather than languages,
so intimate is the connection between them, so
slight the differences by which they are separated. It is
quite otherwise if we turn to a group like the Malayo-Polynesian,
where the word <i>oran</i>, “man,” may be represented
in the different dialects by <i>rang</i>, <i>olan</i>, <i>lan</i>, <i>ala</i>, <i>la</i>,
<i>na</i>, <i>da</i>, and <i>ra</i>.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> But here, too, the law of equivalence is
fixed and determinate: the Samoan <i>s</i> is changed into
<i>h</i> in Tongan and Maori, while the Maori <i>k</i> is dropped in
Samoan.</p>

<p>Equally extensive is the series of changes undergone
by sounds in the Ugro-Finnic tongues, and when the
law of sound-shifting has been determined not only
for the Ugro-Finnic division of the Turanian family,
but for the whole Turanian family, comprising Turkish,
Mongol, and Mandshu, we may expect it to include
a far larger number of changes of sound than that
summed up in Grimm’s law. So far as the Ugro-Finnic
dialects are concerned, M. de Ujfálvy, in continuance of
the investigations of Riedl,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> has been able to lay down
the following rules for the phonetic permutations observable
in these idioms: (1) The Finnish and Bulgar <i>k</i>
becomes <i>kh</i> in Ostiak, Vogul, and Old Magyár, and <i>h</i> in
modern Magyár; (2) <i>k</i> = <i>ts</i>; (3) <i>k</i> or <i>g</i> = <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>ṣ</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>ts</i>, &amp;c.;
(4) Finnish <i>ks</i> = Votiak <i>hs</i> (earlier <i>ht</i>); (5) Finnish <i>kl</i>,
<i>pl</i> = Lapp <i>vl</i>; (6) Medial Finnish <i>k</i> and <i>h</i> = Bulgar and
Ugrian <i>v</i> and <i>f</i>; (7) Initial Finnish <i>h</i> disappears in
Livonian and Lapp (in Lapp also becomes <i>v</i> before a
dental); (8) Finnish <i>h</i> = <i>s</i>, <i>ṣ</i>, <i>ts</i>, <i>sy</i>, <i>ts</i> (<i>c</i>), <i>ẓ</i>, <i>tsy</i>, &amp;c.; (9)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
Finnish and Bulgar <i>k</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i> = Lapp and Ostiak <i>ng</i>, <i>n</i> =
Magyar <i>g</i>; (10) Medial Finnish <i>nk</i> = Lapp <i>gg</i>; (11)
Finnish <i>nt</i> = Lapp <i>dd</i>; (12) <i>gy</i>, <i>ny</i> = <i>y</i>, <i>v</i>; (13) <i>t</i> = <i>s</i>
(Finnish <i>t</i> = <i>s</i>, <i>ṣ</i>, <i>sy</i>, <i>ts</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>ẓ</i>, &amp;c.); (14) Finnish <i>s</i>, <i>h</i> =
Ostiak and Vogul <i>t</i>; (15) Finnish <i>p</i> = Votiak <i>b</i> = Magyar
<i>b</i>, <i>f</i>; (16) Finnish <i>t</i> = Magyar <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>ts</i>; (17) Finnish <i>m</i> =
Lapp <i>bm</i>; (18) Lapp <i>dn</i> = Finnish <i>nn</i> or <i>n</i>; (19) Finnish
<i>mb</i> = Lapp <i>bb</i>; (20) Finnish <i>kk</i>, <i>tt</i>, <i>pp</i> = Vêpse and Livonian
<i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i>; (21) Finnish <i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i> = Vêpse and Livonian
<i>g</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>b</i>. This list of phonetic equivalents will make it
clear that the original phonology of the Ugro-Finnic
group is generally best represented by Suomi or Finnish;
in some cases, however, Vêpse (or Tchude) is more
archaic than Finnish, and in one case, that of the change
of <i>t</i> into <i>s</i>, Ostiak and Vogul are more primitive than
Suomi. Vêpse, again, shows that the long vowels of
Suomi are due to contraction. Within Suomi itself <i>kk</i>,
<i>tt</i>, and <i>pp</i>, after a liquid are softened into simple <i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, and
<i>p</i>. The diphthongal consonants of Magyár (<i>ly</i>, <i>my</i>, <i>ty</i>,
&amp;c.), are the result of a contraction of a consonant and a
vowel or diphthong following. The changes undergone
by sounds within the Ugro-Finnic group may be summed
up as a whole in the two formulæ: (1) The Finnish hard
explosives are represented by soft explosives in the other
languages of the group; (2) spirants, and the sounds
derived from them, answer in the allied dialects to the
explosives of Finnish. As for the Samoied idioms,
similar phonetic permutations may be discovered in
them also. In the Yurak dialect <i>h</i> = <i>s</i>, <i>ng</i> = <i>nr</i>, and <i>k</i> =
<i>ts</i>; in Tavghi <i>k</i> and <i>t</i> tend to become <i>g</i> and <i>d</i>; in
Yenissei <i>dd</i> = <i>md</i> (<i>nt</i>, <i>nd</i>, <i>ntt</i>, <i>ltt</i>), <i>gg</i> = <i>rk</i> (<i>rg</i>) or <i>nk</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
<i>tt</i> = <i>bt</i>, while in Ostiak-Samoied and Kamassinche the
hard explosives pass into the soft <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>b</i>.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Quite as regular as the permutations of sounds in
the Finnic group is the law of sound-change discovered
by Bleek to exist in the Bâ-ntu or Kafir family. The
following table gives it for the principal members of the
group:—</p>

<p>The Bâ-ntu law of sound-shifting has the advantage
over its Aryan analogue, that it deals with actually existing
sounds which can still be heard and noted by the
scientifically trained ear, whereas many of the Aryan
languages and sounds recorded in Grimm’s law are now
extinct. The Aryan philologist, accordingly, has to
assume that the spelling of Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and
Gothic words is a fair approximation to their pronunciation.
It is upon this assumption that the whole fabric
of historical grammar is built; nay, comparative philology
itself, which began with the comparison of allied forms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
and words in the classical languages of India and Europe,
is also based upon it. The assumption offers little
difficulty to the Italian, whose spelling accurately represents
his pronunciation, or to the German, who writes
pretty much as he speaks; but it need not be pointed out
how strange and unnatural it seems to the Englishman.
English spelling, under the guidance of the printers, has
become a mere system of marks and symbols, arranged
upon no principle, selected with no rational purpose,
each of which by a separate effort of the memory is
associated with some sound or word.</p>

<p>For the scientific philologist, no less than for the
practical teacher, a return to the phonetic spelling of our
English language is of the highest importance. What
the philologist wishes to know is not how words are
spelt, but how they are pronounced, and this end can be
obtained only by means of an alphabet in which all the
chief sounds of the language are represented, and each
character represents but one sound. No doubt the practical
man does not want the alphabet required by the
phonologist, who must denote every shade of sound and
have separate symbols for the sounds heard not in
English only, but in other languages as well, but the
alphabet of the practical man should be based on that of
the phonologist. The reformed alphabet should be one
which would enable the child or the foreigner to recognize
at once the sound of the word he is reading, and the
philologist to determine the pronunciation of the writer.</p>

<p>Thanks to Messrs. Ellis, Pitman, and others, the
question of reforming our English spelling has not only
been brought before the public, but the conditions under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
which it is practicable have been discussed and ascertained,
and the merits of rival schemes put to the test.
The sounds of the English language have been analyzed,
and the great work of Mr. A. J. Ellis on the “History
of English Pronunciation” has shown how our absurd
and anomalous spelling grew up. At the present time
we have in the field the phonology of Mr. Pitman—an
alphabet of thirty-eight letters—a large proportion of
which have new forms; the palæotype and glossic of
Mr. Ellis, the former retaining the type now used by
the printers, but enlarging the alphabet by turning the
letters, and similar devices, the latter by its likeness to
the present spelling intended to bridge over the passage
from the present or “Nomic” mode of spelling to the reformed
one; the narrow and the broad Romic of Mr.
Sweet, the second an adaptation of the first to practical
use; the ingenious system of Mr. E. Jones, which by the
employment of optional letters for the same sound contrives
to introduce little <i>apparent</i> difference in the spelling
of English words; and several other English and
American systems that have been proposed, more especially
the reformed alphabet of the American Philological
Association, together with the transitional alphabet intended
to lead on to it. Some of these are true phonetic
alphabets, words spelt in them varying according to the
pronunciation of the writer, others are merely attempts
to reform the present spelling of English words by
making it more consistent, and bringing it more into
harmony with their actual pronunciation. Such attempts
would only substitute a less objectionable mode of spelling
for the existing one, a mode of spelling, too, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
would in course of time become as stereotyped and far
removed from the pronunciation of the day as is the
present system. With such attempts, therefore, the
scientific philologist can have but little sympathy; his
efforts must rather be directed towards the establishment
of a phonetic alphabet, based on a thorough analysis of
English sounds and conformed to practical requirements.</p>

<p>The question of spelling reform is nothing new. Mr.
Ellis has brought to light a MS. written in 1551 by
John Hart of Chester, and entitled “The Opening of the
unreasonable writing of our inglish toung: wherin is
shewed what necessarili is to be left, and what folowed
for the perfect writing therof.” This the author followed
up by a published work in 1569, called “An Orthographie,
conteyning the due order and reason, howe to
write or painte thimage of mannes voice, most like to the
life or nature.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The object of this, he says, “is to vse
as many letters in our writing, as we doe voyces or
breathes in our speaking, and no more; and neuer to
abuse one for another, and to write as we speake.” Hart,
however, it would seem, tried to amend the pronunciation
as well as the spelling of English. The year before
(1568) Sir Thomas Smith, Secretary of State in 1548,
and successor of Burleigh, had published at the famous
press of Robert Stephens in Paris, a work, “De recta et
emendata linguæ anglicæ scriptione, dialogus.” In this
he had suggested a reformed alphabet of thirty-four
characters, <i>c</i> being used for <i>ch</i>, ð for <i>th</i> (in <i>then</i>), and θ for
<i>th</i> (in <i>think</i>), long vowels being indicated by a diæresis.
In 1580 came another book in black letter on the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
subject, by William Bullokar. His alphabet consisted of
thirty-seven letters, most of which have duplicate forms,
and in which <i>c’</i>, <i>g’</i>, and <i>v’</i>, represent <i>s</i>, <i>j</i>, and <i>v</i>. He composed
a primer and a short pamphlet in the orthography
he advocated. In 1619, Dr. Gill, head-master of St.
Paul’s School, published his “Logonomia Anglica,”
which was quickly followed by a second edition in 1621.
His alphabet contained forty characters, and, as might
be expected from his position, his attempt to reform
English spelling was a more scholarly one than those of
his predecessors. He found a rival in the Rev. Charles
Butler, an M.A. of Magdalen College, Oxford, who
brought out at Oxford, in 1633, “The English Grammar,
or the Institution of Letters, Syllables, and Words in the
English Tongue.” He printed this phonetically, according
to his own system, as well as another book, “The
Feminine Monarchy or History of the Bees” (Oxford,
1634). “These,” says Mr. Ellis, “are the first English
books entirely printed phonetically, as only half of Hart’s
was so presented. But Meigret’s works were long anterior
in French.” Butler represents the final <i>e</i> mute by ’.
In 1668 Bishop Wilkins published his great work, the
“Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical
Language.” In this he has a good treatise on phonetics,
in which he probably made use of an important work on
the physiological nature of sounds, brought out by John
Wallis, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford, in
1653;<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and he has transcribed the Lord’s Prayer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
Creed in his phonetic alphabet of thirty-seven letters.
After Bishop Wilkins the matter rested for a while; but
in 1711 the question of reforming English spelling was
once more raised, this time, however, in a practical direction.
Dean Swift appealed to the Prime Minister to appoint
a commission for “the Ascertaining, Correcting,
and Improving of the English Tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> His appeal,
however, was without effect; and the next to apply himself
to the subject was Benjamin Franklin, who, in 1768,
put forth “A Scheme for a New Alphabet and reformed
mode of Spelling, with Remarks and Examples concerning
the same, and an Enquiry into its Uses.” Franklin
embodied his views in a letter to Miss Stephenson (dated
September 20th, 1768), written in his phonetic alphabet,
and intended to meet objections to the proposed reform.
It is curious to find the wholly mistaken objection already
put forward that “all our etymologies would be lost” by
a reform of spelling.</p>

<p>But spelling reformers have not been confined to
England. Ninety years ago a reform of Dutch spelling
was successfully carried out, though the result was unsatisfactory,
as might have been expected from the ignorance
of phonology that existed at the time. Spanish
spelling has recently undergone revision on the part of
the Academy; and even German, which seems to the
Englishman so far advanced on the road towards perfection,
is in process of reformation. The work was begun
by Schleicher, who not only struck out the aphonic <i>h</i> and
other useless letters, but even emulated the Emperor
Claudius by inventing a new character. A committee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
was lately appointed by the Minister of Education to
decide upon such changes of spelling as seemed to them
desirable, and a thorough-going system of reform, with a
new alphabet, like that of Mr. Pitman, has been inaugurated
through the exertions of Dr. Frikke and others.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Of scientific alphabets, also, the phonologist has now
his choice. Putting aside Melville Bell’s “Visible Speech,”
in which each character symbolizes by lines the action of
the vocal organs in forming the sound it represents, the
best are the well-known “Standard” and “Missionary
Alphabets” of Lepsius and Max Müller, the alphabets of
Ellis and Prince L-L. Bonaparte, and the alphabet of
Sweet. Max Müller’s alphabet is founded on that of Sir
W. Jones, and he brings with justice the charge against
Lepsius’s “Standard Alphabet” that its physiological
analysis is sometimes wrong, and that many of its characters
have been found too complicated for use. Sweet’s
alphabet has the advantage of avoiding new type, of
having special signs for voice and whisper, for quantity
and stress, force, pitch, and glide, and of indicating by a
full stop the place of a “force-impulse.” Prince L-L.
Bonaparte’s alphabet, however, as edited by Ellis, is the
most complete; indeed, out of his 385 characters, there
occur a few which have not been detected in any known
language. The two last alphabets will be found in the
Appendix to the present chapter.</p>

<p>It is possible that the phonograph may hereafter assist
us in constructing a more perfect alphabet than is now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
possible. Just as Melville Bell’s letters have a physiological
origin, so the letters of the alphabet of the future
may be derived from the forms assumed by sounds on
the sensitive plate of the phonograph. The phonautograph
had already informed us that every sound we utter
has a distinct shape and pattern; it only remained to
apply this fact practically by the invention of the phonograph.</p>

<p>The phonautograph as constructed by Barlow, Léon
Scott, and König, is made to record the sounds of the
human voice by the help either of a pencil or of a gas-flame.
The pencil is set in motion by a thin membrane,
against which sounds and words are spoken, and draws
on a cylinder covered with sand the curves which delineate
the sounds uttered. When a gas-flame is employed,
the forms assumed by it take the place of those
drawn on the sand. In Edison’s phonograph the fact
that the form of every sound can thus be imprinted on a
tangible substance has been utilized for the reproduction
of speech. A plate of tin-foil is folded round a revolving
cylinder indented from one end to the other with a spiral
groove. As the cylinder revolves the groove is kept
constantly beneath a needle, which is attached to a membrane
or sounding-board, against which the voice is impinged
through a conical aperture: with each sound that
is uttered the needle presses the tin-foil into the furrow
below, imprinting upon it at the same time the form of
the sound. By reversing the process the needle is made
to travel once more over the indented tin-foil, and the
sounding-board being thus set in motion reproduces the
sounds originally spoken. Before the tin-foil is thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
reduced to its original smoothness, a cast of it may be
taken, and at any subsequent period another piece of tin-foil
may receive the impression of the cast, and so reproduce
the words which first caused the indentations. It is
needless to point out the assistance which the phonograph
is likely to render to phonology. It is still, of course,
new and faulty, and unable, for instance, to reproduce
sibilants; but it cannot fail to be improved and become
almost as perfect a speaking-machine as the human
throat itself. Already it has contributed some facts of
importance to phonetic science. Thus we find that all
sounds may be reproduced backwards by simply beginning
with the last forms indented on the tin-foil, <i>sociability</i>,
for example, becoming <i>ytilibaishos</i>. Diphthongs
and double consonants may be reversed with equal clearness
and precision, so that <i>bite</i>, which the phonograph
pronounces <i>bâ-eet</i>, becomes <i>tee-âb</i> In this way we have
learnt that the <i>ch</i> of <i>cheque</i> is really a double letter, the
reversed pronunciation of the word being <i>kesht</i>.</p>

<p>The problem of reproducing human speech has thus
been approached more successfully from the physical and
acoustic side than from the physiological side, where it
was attacked by Faber, Kempelen, and others. They
attempted to construct instruments in which the vocal
organs could be represented with the greatest exactness
attainable, the lungs being replaced by a pair of bellows,
the trachea by a hollow tube, and so on. But though
these instruments spoke, it was not in human speech, or
anything like it. The utmost they could do was to imitate
the first utterances of a child, or the imperfect and laboured
syllables of one who is learning a foreign tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not in the organs of the human
voice any more than in the mechanism of a lifeless instrument
that we have to discover the source and creator of
speech. All that the vocal organs can do is to supply the
skeleton into which the mind breathes the breath of life.
Unmeaning sounds do not constitute language: until a
signification has been put into them, the sounds that have
been described and analyzed are no better than the singing
of the birds, the stirring of the trees, or even the dead
utterances of a machine. Phonology, like anatomy, deals
only with the dry bones which have yet to be clothed
upon with living flesh.</p>

<p>But by its very nature a science of meanings, sematology,
as it has been named, can never have the same
certitude, the same exactness, as a science of sounds.
The laws of sematology are far less distinct and invariable;
significant change cannot be reduced to the same
set of fixed rules as phonetic change. The phenomena
with which sematology deals are too complicated, too
dependent on psychological conditions; the element of
chance or conscious exertion of will seems to enter into
them, and it is often left to the arbitrary choice of an
individual to determine the change of meaning to be undergone
by a word. Still this meaning must be accepted
by the community before it can become part of language;
unless it is so accepted it will remain a mere
literary curiosity in the pages of a technical dictionary.
And since its acceptance by the community is due to
general causes, influencing many minds alike, it is possible
to analyze and formulate these causes, in fact, to refer
significant change to certain definite principles, to bring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
it under certain definite generalizations. Moreover, it
must be remembered that the ideas suggested by most
words are what Locke calls “mixed modes.” A word
like <i>just</i> or <i>beauty</i> is but a shorthand note suggesting a
number of ideas more or less associated with one another.
But the ideas associated with it in one mind cannot be
exactly those associated with it in another; to one man
it suggests what it does not to another. So long as we
move in a society subjected to the same social influences
and education as ourselves we do not readily perceive the
fact, since the leading ideas called up by the word will
be alike for all; but it is quite otherwise when we come
to deal with those whose education has been imperfect
as compared with our own. A young speaker often imagines
that he makes himself intelligible to an uneducated
audience by using short and homely words; unless he
also suits his ideas to theirs, he will be no better understood
than if he spoke in the purest Johnsonese. If we
are suddenly brought into contact with experts in a
subject we have not studied, or dip into a book on an
unfamiliar branch of knowledge, we seem to be listening
to the meaningless sounds of a foreign tongue. The
words used may not be technical words; but familiar
words and expressions will bear senses and suggest ideas
to those who use them which they will not bear to us. It
is impossible to convey in a translation all that is meant
by the original writer. We may say that the French
<i>juste</i> answers to the English <i>just</i>, and so it does in a
rough way; but the train of thoughts associated with
<i>juste</i> is not that associated with <i>just</i>, and the true
meaning of a passage may often depend more on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
the associated thoughts than on the leading idea itself.
Nearly every word, in fact, may be described as a
complex of ideas which is not the same in the minds
of any two individuals, its general meaning lying in
the common ideas attached to it by all the members
of a particular society. The significations, therefore,
with which the comparative philologist has to concern
himself, are those unconsciously agreed upon by
a body of men, or rather the common group of ideas
suggested by a word to all of them alike. Here, again,
some general causes must be at work which may yet be
revealed by a careful analysis. The comparative philologist
has not to trouble himself, like the classical
philologist, with discovering the exact ideas connected
with a word by some individual author; it is the meaning
of words as they are used in current speech, not as
they illustrate the idiosyncrasies of a writer, which it is
his province to investigate.</p>

<p>“The genealogies of words,” says Pott,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> “are the genealogies
of concepts.” As in phonology we have the
growth or decay of sounds, so in sematology we have the
growth or decay of ideas. The three principles of linguistic
change, imitation, emphasis and laziness, are incessantly
at work on the meanings as well as upon the
sounds of words. Analogy is ever lending them new
senses, and the metaphorical senses may come to be
used to the utter forgetfulness of the original one. The
Latin who spoke of his “mind” or “soul” as <i>animus</i>
had altogether forgotten that at the outset <i>animus</i> was
merely the “wind” or “breath.” Here analogy or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
imitation is helped by laziness, which makes us forget a
little-used meaning. <i>Impertinent</i> has almost lost its
prior and proper signification, and our children will have
to seek it in the records of an obsolescent literature. But
a dead meaning may again rise to life; the early meaning
of a word, whether recovered from books or from the
fresh spring of a local dialect, may once more impress itself
upon a community anxious to emphasize and mark
out an idea by an unfamiliar term.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> has summed up significant change
under the two heads of specialization of general terms
and generalization of special terms, but a more thorough-going
attempt to determine its laws and distinguish its
causes has been made by Pott.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> First of all, he points
out, words may be more accurately defined either by
widening or by narrowing their signification. While in
the Neo-Latin languages <i>caballus</i>, “a nag,” has taken the
wider meaning of “horse” in general, under the form of
<i>cavallo</i> or <i>cheval</i>, the modern Greek ἄλογον is no longer
the “irrational beast,” but is narrowed into the specific
sense of “horse.” Like our <i>deer</i>, which once meant “wild
animals” generally (German <i>thier</i>), so <i>emere</i> has narrowed
its primary signification of “taking” into the special one
of “buying.” But, on the other hand, when we speak
of “going to town,” it is not “town” in general or any
town whatsoever that is meant, but London alone.</p>

<p>Then, secondly, there is metaphor, with its ceaseless
play upon speech. Language is the treasure-house of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
worn-out similes, a living testimony to the instinct of
man to find likeness and resemblance in all he sees. The
Tasmanians, who had no general terms, had yet the
power of seeing resemblances between things: though
they could not form the concept “round,” they said “like
the moon” or some other round object. All the words
which have a spiritual or moral meaning go back to a
purely sensuous origin: <i>Divus</i>, <i>Deus</i>, <i>Dieu</i> was once “the
bright sky;” <i>soul</i> was nothing but the “heaving” sea. It
is only by likening such ideas to the objects of sense that
we can imagine them at all, or convey a hint of our
meaning to others. The vocabulary of a language on its
significant side grows by metaphor and analogy. We
have only to take a word like <i>post</i>, once the Latin <i>positum</i>,
“what is fixed” or “placed,” and trace it through
its many derived meanings of “stake,” “position,” “office,”
“station,” “public medium of correspondence,” and “receptacle
for letters,” to see how endless are the shades of
colour which a single word may catch from those with
which it is associated. To know the idioms of a language
and the conditions under which its speakers live, is often
to know the history of the changes in signification undergone
by its vocabulary. The mere expression “send to
the post” gave to the word <i>post</i> its last meaning of a
building in which letters are deposited and sorted, and
the conditions of schoolboy life are a clue to many of the
metaphorical uses of words which bear quite another
meaning in school life from what they do in ordinary
language. Where else but in a country of examinations
could “pass” signify to go through an examination with
success? Each craft, each industry has its own store of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
technical words, many of which are merely words in
common use employed in particular senses intelligible
only to those who belong to it.</p>

<p>Words, thirdly, will vary in meaning according to their
application to persons or things, to what is good or bad,
great or small. What a difference there is, for instance,
between a “beautiful woman” and a “beautiful picture,”
“a fine day” and “a fine fellow.” <i>Silly</i>, again, is simply
the German <i>selig</i>, “blessed,” and such is still its meaning
in Spenser’s “silly sheep;” but in modern English it has
long lost its favourable sense, and is used only in an unfavourable
one. Diminutives, originally the symbols of
affection, have in many cases become the symbols of
contempt, while “childishness” is as much a compliment
when applied to a child as it is the reverse when applied
to a man.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, words change their signification
according to their use as active or passive, as subjects
or as objects. “The sight of a thing” has a very different
meaning from “the enjoyment of a sight,” as different,
in fact, as is the meaning of <i>venerandus</i> when
applied to the object of veneration or to his admirer.
The passive has been evolved from the middle τύπτομαι,
“I beat myself” passing gradually into “I am beaten.”
In English we may say indifferently “a matter is reflected,”
or “a matter reflects itself,” after the usage of
French. Similarly a neuter verb may be regarded as an
active followed by the reflective pronoun; our “to be
silent,” or “to walk,” for example, are the French “se
taire,” “se promener.”</p>

<p>Fifthly, an idea may be expressed either by a compound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
or periphrasis, or by a single word. The Latin
<i>nepos</i> is the French <i>petit fils</i>, our “ninety” the French
<i>quatre-vingt-dix</i>. The Taic languages of Further India
preserve the primitive habit of denoting a new idea by
comparing it with some other to which it stands in the
relation of species to genus. Thus in Siamese “a heifer”
is <i>lúk nghoa</i>, “child (of a) bull;” “a lamb” is <i>lúk-ké</i>,
“child (of a) sheep,” much as in English <i>inkstand</i> is “a
stand for ink.” It is only by comparison that an object
can be known, its limits marked and determined; it is
equally only by comparison that an idea can be defined
and made intelligible. But when this has once been
done, there is no longer any need of setting genus and
species side by side in speech and thought; to do so is
but a survival of the early machinery of language. The
fact that the derivatives of the Aryan speaker are replaced
by compounds, or rather antithetic words, in Taic,
shows not only the mental superiority of the former, but
also the fundamental contrast that exists between the
two modes of thought. Collectives imply no small power
of abstraction, and the collectives formed by antithesis
in Taic are as much a proof of it as the existence of our
“contentment” by the side of the Siamese <i>arói chái</i>,
literally “pleasant heart.”</p>

<p>In the sixth place, we must always keep steadily in
view the relativity of ideas and of the words which denote
them. The same word may be applied in a variety
of senses, the particular sense which it bears being determined
by the context. The manifold shades of meaning
of which each word is capable, the different associations
of ideas which it may excite, give rise to varieties of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
signification which in course of time develop into distinct
species. Hence come the idioms that form the characteristic
feature of a dialect or language, and make exact
translation into another language so impossible. Hence,
too, that diversification of synonyms which causes words
like <i>womanly</i> and <i>feminine</i> gradually to assume different
meanings, and prevent us from saying “I am very
obliged,” or “I am much tired.”</p>

<p>Seventhly and lastly, change of signification may follow
in the wake of change of pronunciation or the introduction
of new words. Phonetic decay may cause the old form
of a word to be forgotten, and so allow it to assume the
new meaning which has gradually been evolved out of its
earlier one. This is the history of most of those inflections
which can be traced back to independent words,
such as the sign of the past tense in English, once the
reduplicated perfect of <i>do</i>. The signification of <i>jeopardy</i>
has travelled far from that of <i>jeu parti</i>, but preparation
had first been made by the change of pronunciation.
There are many myths and mythological beings which
owe their existence to the same cause. It was not till
Promêtheus had lost all resemblance in outward name to
the <i>pramanthas</i> or “fire-machine” of India that he borrowed
his attributes from προμήδομαι, and became the wise
benefactor of mankind, the gifted seer of the future,
whose brother was Epimêtheus, or “Afterthought.” It
is the same with the legends that group themselves round
the distorted name of a locality. The nose of brass or
gilt which adorns Brasenose College at Oxford could
never have come into existence until the old <i>Brasinghouse</i>
or “Brewery” had been transformed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
phœnix that stands in the centre of the Phœnix Park at
Dublin, would have been impossible without the assistance
of Saxon lips, which turned the Irish <i>fion uisg</i> or
“fine water” into <i>phœnix</i>. But change of pronunciation
is especially serviceable in increasing the wealth of a
language by producing two co-ordinate forms out of a
single original one. In course of time the two forms
assume different meanings, due to the different contexts
in which they may be used, and when once all memory
of the original identity has perished, the distinction of
meaning becomes fixed and permanent, and tends to
grow continually sharper. In the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
a Latin writer could still use <i>prior</i> as a neuter, <i>prios</i> or
<i>prius</i> as a masculine; but a time soon came when <i>prior</i>
was classed exclusively with other masculine nouns in
-<i>or</i> or -<i>tor</i>, <i>prius</i> with neuter nouns like <i>genus</i>. So, again,
the Latin infinitive active <i>amare</i> and the infinitive passive
<i>amari</i> were at the outset one and the same—the
dative singular of a verbal noun in -<i>s</i> (<i>amas</i>-), and one
verb, <i>fio</i>, the Greek φυ(ι)ω, continued to the last to preserve
a recollection of the fact by the length of the final
syllable in <i>fieri</i> or <i>fiesei</i>, “to become.” But the shortening
of final syllables which characterizes Latin was early at
work, and out of the dative <i>amasei</i> soon originated the two
co-existing forms <i>amase</i> (<i>amare</i>) and <i>amasi</i> (<i>amari</i>). For
a while they were used indifferently, but when the distinction
that exists between the German <i>waren zu haben</i>
and the English “were to be had” came to make itself
felt, one form remained the property of the active, while
the other was appropriated to the passive. But a consciousness
of the origin of <i>amari</i> seems to have long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
survived in the language, since there was a tendency to
associate it more closely with the other forms of the
passive voice by affixing to it the characteristic of the
passive, <i>r</i> (<i>amarier</i>). What is here effected by the diversification
of the same word, may also be effected by the
diversification of two synonyms, one of which has come
from abroad. Sometimes both may come from abroad,
but at different times, the result being that whereas one
of them has been naturalized in the language, the other
is but the nurseling of a learned age. <i>Priest</i> and <i>presbyter</i>,
for instance, have both descended from the same source,
and were once identical in meaning. But not only may
the old words of a dialect be thus affected by new comers,
the foreign words may even succeed in destroying the
native ones altogether. The same natural selection which
has wellnigh extirpated many of the native plants of
Central America in the presence of the imported cardoon,
is also at work in language. Our Old English <i>sicker</i> has
had to give way before <i>sure</i>, the Old French <i>sëur</i>, Provençal
<i>segur</i>, Latin <i>securus</i>, and the Latin <i>equus</i> has
been replaced in the Romanic dialects by <i>caballus</i>, “a
nag.” <i>Caballus</i> is at once an example of the way in
which the meaning of a word may be widened, and of
the operation of natural selection in the field of speech.</p>

<p>The etymologist must keep before him the laws both
of phonology and of sematology before he can venture to
group words together and refer them to a common root.
For the etymologist is not merely a historian, or student
of historical grammar; above and beyond the words
which can be traced back, step by step, to their early
forms, by the help of contemporaneous records, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
are many more, the derivation of which has to be constructed
much in the same way that a palæontologist reconstructs
a fossil animal by the help of a single bone.
The task is often a difficult and a delicate one, and the
best trained scholars may sometimes fail. The result of
false analogy may be regarded as an organic form, or
a foreign word, conformed possibly to the genius of the
language which has borrowed it, may be mistaken for a
native. The præ-Aryan populations of Greece or of
Britain must have left some remains of their languages in
the vocabulary of Greek and Keltic, and Greek and Keltic
words which have been counted as Aryan may, after all, be
but aliens. Apart from these dangers, there is further the
double one of assuming a connection between ideas which
have nothing to do with one another, and of separating
ideas which start from a common source. On the one hand,
we are apt to judge of primitive man by ourselves, and to
fancy that the ideas which we associate together were
equally associated together by him. On the other hand,
we have only to turn to the Ugrian idioms, with their
greater transparency and openness to analysis to see the
passage of one signification in a root into another of a
wholly different kind, accompanied by a modification of
the vowel. Thus <i>karyan</i> is “to ring,” and “to lighten;”
<i>kar-yun</i> and <i>kir-yun</i>, “to cry,” but <i>kir-on</i>, “to curse;”
<i>kah-isen</i>, <i>koh-isen</i>, <i>kuh-isen</i>, “to hit,” “stamp;” <i>käh-isen</i>,
<i>köh-isen</i>, “to roar;” <i>keh-isen</i>, <i>kih-isen</i>, “to boil.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> We
have here the same symbolization of a change of meaning
by a change of vowel as in the Greek perfect δέδωκα
by the side of the present δίδωμι.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span></p>

<p>The four facts to be remembered in etymology are
thus summarized by Professor Max Müller.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> (1.) The
same word takes different forms in different languages.
Each language or dialect has its peculiar phonetic laws
and tendencies; because a particular interchange of sounds
takes place in one language it does not follow that it does
so in another. In Greek, for instance, <i>s</i> between two vowels
is lost, in Latin it becomes <i>r</i>. Our English <i>two</i> is the
same word, so far as origin is concerned, as the German
<i>zwei</i>, the Latin and Greek <i>duo</i>, the Sanskrit <i>dwi</i>; the
English <i>silly</i> is the German <i>selig</i>, “blessed.” As words
are carried down the stream of time, they change in both
outward form and inward meaning, and this change is in
harmony with the physiological and psychological peculiarities
of the particular people that uses them. (2.) The
same word, again, takes different forms in one and the
same language. <i>Brisk</i>, <i>frisky</i>, and <i>fresh</i> all come from
the same fountain-head, and <i>bank</i> and <i>bench</i> are the differentiated
forms of which <i>banquet</i> is the Romanized
equivalent. So, too, in French <i>noël</i> and <i>natal</i> are but
forms of the same word of different ages, like <i>naïf</i> and
<i>native</i>, <i>chétif</i> and <i>captif</i>. Then (3) different words take
the same form in different languages. The Greek καλέω
and the English <i>call</i> have as little connection as the
Latin <i>sanguis</i> and the Mongol <i>sengui</i>, “blood,” or the
modern Greek <i>mati</i> for ὀμμάτιον, and the Polynesian <i>mata</i>,
“an eye.” To compare words of different languages together
because they agree in sound is to contravene all
the principles of scientific philology; agreement of sound
is the best possible proof of their want of connection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
since each language has its own phonology and consequently
modifies the forms of words in a different fashion.
The comparison even of roots is a dangerous process, not
to be indulged in unless the grammar of the languages
to which they belong has been shown to be of common
origin. What we call roots are only the hypothetical
types to which we can reduce the words of a certain
group of tongues; they are, therefore, merely the expression
of the phonetic laws common to all the members of
the group. But it does not follow that the selected
phonetic laws which all the members of a certain group
of tongues have in common are the same as the phonetic
laws of another language or another group. Roots, moreover,
owing to their shortness, their vagueness, and their
consequent simplicity, are necessarily limited in number,
while the ideas they convey are so wide and general as to
cover an almost infinite series of derived meanings; to
say nothing of the probability that many of them are to
be traced to imitations of natural sounds. (4.) Different
words, in the fourth place, may take the same form in
one and the same language. The French <i>feu</i>, “fire,” is
the Latin <i>focus</i>; <i>feu</i>, “late,” the Low Latin <i>fuitus</i> (from
<i>fui</i>). So too the English <i>page</i>, in the sense of a servant,
comes ultimately from the Greek παίδιον, <i>page</i>, in the
sense of a leaf of a book, from the Latin <i>pagina</i>. An
arbitrary and antiquated spelling may often keep up a
distinction between such words in writing when in speaking
all distinction has long since disappeared. The
French <i>sang</i>, <i>cent</i>, <i>sans</i>, <i>sent</i>, <i>s’en</i>, the English <i>sow</i>, <i>sew</i>,
<i>so</i>, are respectively pronounced in the same way. That
no inconvenience would be caused by writing them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
the same way is shown not only by the fact that many
words of similar sound but varying sense, such as <i>sound</i>,
<i>box</i>, or <i>lie</i>, are not distinguished in writing, but also
by the ease with which we can distinguish between them
in conversation, although in conversation we are unable
to dwell upon a word or view it by the light of the completed
sentence, as is the case in reading. The scientific
etymologist would welcome the accurate representation
of sounds by symbols, his object is to know what sounds
pass into others in the course of centuries, and this he
can only ascertain when the spelling represents the pronunciation;
the amateur etymologist had better leave
the subject alone. Etymology is not a plaything for the
amusement of the ignorant and untrained; it is a serious
and difficult study, not to be attempted without much
preparation and previous research. The etymologist
must be thoroughly trained in the principles of scientific
philology, he must have mastered both phonology and
sematology, and he must be well acquainted with more
than one of the languages with which he deals. Then
and then only can his labours be fruitful; then, and then
only will his work be a gain and not a hindrance. False
etymologies stand in the way of true ones, and the charlatans
who have brought the name of etymology into contempt
have discredited the labours of better men. There
is much in etymology which must always defy analysis,
there is much which will have to be corrected hereafter,
but this will matter little if we have once learnt the
lesson that change of sound and meaning can only take
place in accordance with fixed and invariable law. Etymology
is but a means to an end, and that end is partly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
the history of the development of thought and civilization
as reflected in the fossil records of speech, partly
the discovery and illustration of the laws which govern
the shifting and decay of sounds and the modifications of
sense.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_I_TO_CHAPTER_IV">APPENDIX I. TO CHAPTER IV.<br>
THE VOCAL ORGANS OF ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>Comparative anatomy is the foundation of modern
physiology: to understand the human organism we must
compare it with the organisms of the lower animals. This
is as true of the organs of speech as of the organs of
locomotion or sensation, and we shall find that, in spite
of varying degrees of development, the vocal organs of
both man and beast present a general resemblance to
each other. Some of the quadrumana have large sacs
between the thyroid cartilage and the <i>os hyoideum</i>, which
have much to do with modifying and increasing the resonance
of the voice. The laryngeal sacs possessed by
some of the monkeys of Africa cause the acuteness of
tone and hoarseness of cry that characterize them. The
great intensity of the voice in the American “howlers”
is due to the size of the epiglottis and the existence of
large cavities in the thyroid cartilage and <i>os hyoideum</i>
which communicate with the ventricles of the larynx and
the laryngo-pharyngeal sacs. The bray of the ass has
been traced to two large sacs existing between the vocal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
chords and the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage.
Some of the marsupials, such as the kangaroo, have
membranous vocal chords which stretch upon themselves
and so cannot be stretched by the arytenoid muscles.
A few of the mammalia, <i>e.g.</i> the giraffe, the porcupine,
and the armadillo, have no vocal chords, and are therefore
mute. This is also the case with the cetacea, the bellowing
of the whale being produced by the expulsion of
water through the nostrils during the act of exspiration.</p>

<p>Birds possess a superior larynx which differs considerably
from that of the mammalia, and has nothing to do
with the production of sound. Below this is the inferior
larynx at the lower end of the trachea, just before it bifurcates
into the two bronchi. This is the organ of voice,
and differs a good deal, both in form and structure, in
the several species of birds. It is double, except in the
parrot and a few other birds, and is almost always symmetrical.
It is composed of the lower rings of the trachea
united so as to form a tube, at the lower end of which are
two protuberances, one in front of the other, and joined
together in most birds by a thin rod of bone (the <i>os transversale</i>).
To the upper edge of this bone is attached a
delicate membrane (the <i>membrana semilunaris</i>), which is
turned upwards, and to the lower edge another membrane
(the <i>membrana tympaniformis</i>), formed of the membranous
wall of the bronchus. The latter membrane is highly
developed in singing birds, and still more so in speaking
birds, and it can render the first-mentioned membrane
(with which it is connected) tense when made to vibrate.
In some birds the inferior larynx has as many as five
muscles, in others none. It is wanting altogether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
vultures. It will be seen that the two membranes correspond
to the vocal chords in the mammalia, sounds
being produced by the vibration of their margins. The
various notes are caused by changes in the degree of
tension of the membranes, by differences in the force of
the air-current, and by changes in the length and degree
of tension of the trachea and other parts. The range
of the voice in birds is usually within an octave, but may
be much greater.</p>

<p>Serpents have no vocal chords, and their hiss is the
result of breath being forcibly driven through a soft
glottis. Frogs have no trachea, so that their larynx opens
into the bronchial tubes; but the loudness of the croaking
of male frogs is due to the distension of two membranous
sacs at the sides of the neck. Some frogs have
membranous vocal chords: others two reed-like bodies,
the anterior ends of which are fixed, while the posterior
ends looking into the bronchi are free.</p>

<p>We must wait for the microphone to confute or confirm
the statement of M. Langlois, of Freiburg, that ants
communicate with one another by means of audible
sounds. The recent observations of Sir John Lubbock
seem to show the contrary. At all events, the sounds
produced by most insects are produced externally and
not internally. The stridulation of the cricket or grasshopper
is made by rubbing certain file-like organs against
the edges of membranous drums on the wings. The
pitch of the sounds produced by the cricket is high,
consisting of 4,096 vibrations per second. The shriek
of the death’s-head moth is produced by the friction of
parts connected with the mouth and proboscis, the buzzing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
of flies and gnats by the rapid vibration of two
rudimentary posterior wings called <i>halteres</i>. The humming
of humble-bees, beetles, and the like is due to
the passage of the air through the spiracles.</p>

<p>Fish, with few exceptions, have no special sonorous
apparatus. The noise they make when taken out of the
water is caused by the sucking or flapping movements of
their mouth or gill coverings. It is possible that the air-bladder
opening into the pharynx which is possessed by
some fish, may enable them to emit sounds.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPEECH.</span></h2>

<p>“In der Wirklichkeit wird die Rede nicht aus ihr vorangegangenen
Wörtern zusammengesetzt, sondern die Wörter gehen umgekehrt
aus dem ganzen der Rede hervor.”—<span class="smcap">W. von Humboldt.</span></p>

<p>“Rien n’autorise donc à admettre deux moments dans la création
du langage: un premier moment, où il n’aurait eu que des radicaux,
à la manière chinoise, et un second moment, où il serait arrivé à la
grammaire.”—<span class="smcap">Renan.</span></p>

</div>

<p>We have seen in an earlier chapter that the form under
which our thought may express itself in language is
capable of many variations. The minds of men and
races are very various, and what may seem a perfectly
natural mode of thought and expression to one man may
be wholly strange and unnatural to another. It is as
difficult for us to realize the conception of the sentence
formed by the Chinaman, as it is for the Chinaman to
realize ours. The world wears a different aspect to different
individuals, and the relation of the speaker to the
things about him may be regarded in widely different
ways. Races start each with a peculiar temperament
and peculiar characteristics; indeed, it is just these peculiarities
that constitute what we call a race. And race
peculiarities become strengthened by time and tradition,
by the continuous influence of the circumstances which
have at once created and fostered them. What may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
have been only a tendency in the beginning becomes in
the end a settled and permanent feature; the germ develops
into the full-grown organism, and in the course
of ages makes explicit all the possibilities that lie implicit
within it. The manifold races of mankind do not all
think in the same manner, and the divergent modes in
which they think are reflected in the languages they utter.</p>

<p>Hence it is that languages can be classed morphologically,
that is, according to the form assumed by the sentence.
Here the sentence may be built, as it were, around
a verb, there any conception of a verb may be absent;
here its several parts may be regarded as so many equipollent
monads, set one against the other, there as interdependent
pieces of a Chinese puzzle which all fit into
their appropriate places. In one class of tongues the
root may be monosyllabic, in another polysyllabic; one
language may interpose the stem between the root and
the grammatical suffix, another may know nothing of
such an intermediary. Morphologically, therefore, languages
differ from each other in the structure of the
sentence and the grammatical relation of its parts.</p>

<p>Now we must not forget that the idea of race has not
the same signification for the glottologist that it has for
the physiologist. For the student of language it means
an assemblage of psychological and physiological peculiarities
which are expressed in articulate speech. For
him the European Jew, who has no language but that of
the country in which he is settled, is a member of the
European race; only the Jew whose mother-tongue belongs
to the Semitic stock can be reckoned a Semite. At
the outset, no doubt, race meant the same thing in both a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
glottological and a physiological sense. The characteristics
which reflected themselves in language were characteristics
of which the physiologist has to take account.
But the physiological races of the modern world are far
more mixed than the languages they speak; the physiologist
has much more difficulty in distinguishing his
races than has the glottologist in distinguishing his
families of speech.</p>

<p>But, as elsewhere in nature, so, too, in the domain of
language, species passes gradually and insensibly into
species, class into class. The types remain clear and
strongly-marked, but the dividing lines between them are
hard to draw. Around each type is grouped a large
assemblage of languages which stand at a perpetually
widening distance from it; on the one side the furthest
member of the group almost loses itself in the outlying
member of another, while the most distant member on
the other side can with difficulty be distinguished from
the most distant member of a third group. Isolating
Chinese presents the phænomena of agglutination and
even of inflection; the agglutinative Finnic dialects approach
so nearly to inflection that attempts have been
made to include them in the Aryan family; and English
is in many respects highly agglutinative and even polysynthetic,
while the French <i>je vous donne</i> is almost as
good an instance of incorporation as could be given from
Basque itself. But with all this gradual approximation
the several types of language still remain fixed and distinct.
The Chinese in its main features, in its bone and
muscle, so to say, continues true to its isolating type,
just as Finnic continues true to its agglutinative type, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
French to its inflectional one. The greater or less
departure of a language from its primitive type is due to
several causes. First of all, race in language may become
mixed just as much as race in physiology. Contact
between two languages produces not only mixture in
their vocabularies, but a mutual influence upon their
phonology, and even grammar as well. This is a point
to which we shall have to return hereafter. Few languages
any more than races in the physiological sense
can have remained quite isolated during the long course
of their history or been preserved from contact with
languages of an alien class. Then, secondly, with all
their differences the minds of most men are cast in the
same mould. Thought is one, as a philosopher has said,
though the forms under which it shows itself are infinitely
various. Unity underlies diversity, and this unity finds
its expression in the tendency of all languages to break
away from their types and assume common forms. It is
true that a language cannot wholly break away from its
type without becoming another language, and so ceasing
to exist; it is true, also, that such a psychological
change as would be implied by the occurrence is almost
inconceivable, and is certainly contrary to historical experience;
but nevertheless languages belonging to two
different types may gradually approach one another
during the long ages of their development, and the difficulty
experienced by the student in deciding to which
type they belong may testify to the similarity of the intellectual
outfit of all mankind. Here, at any rate, we
can discover a common origin, a common descent for
the manifold branches of the human family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span></p>

<p>Schlegel’s attempt to divide languages morphologically
has already been described. He distinguished them
primarily as inorganic and organic, the first class including
languages “with grammatical structure,” like the
Chinese, and languages with affixes, and the second class,
including the synthetic or ancient and analytic or modern
dialects of the inflectional tongues. Pott, following Wilhelm
von Humboldt, established the division which with
various modifications is still upheld by most linguistic
students. According to this the languages of the world
fall into four groups, the polysynthetic (such as the
Eskimaux or the Mexican), the isolating (like the
Chinese), the agglutinative (like the Turkish), and the
inflectional (like Sanskrit). The first group he terms
transnormal, the second two intra-normal, and the third
alone normal. Bopp falls back upon Schlegel’s classification,
making but three kinds of speech, the isolating
with monosyllabic roots but “without organism, without
grammar;” the languages capable of composition, of
which the Indo-European form the highest type; and
the Semitic languages which denote the relations of
grammar by internal vowel-change. Schleicher, like
Max Müller, discards the first or polysynthetic class of
Humboldt and Pott, while Max Müller acutely seeks
historical support for the threefold division by referring
the isolating languages to races which have not risen
above family-life, the agglutinative to nomad tribes, and
the inflectional to peoples who have arrived at the conception
of the state.</p>

<p>All these divisions, so far as they are founded in fact,
are really based, not on the word, but on the sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
and only have a meaning if we explain them as representing
the different forms under which the sentence has
been conceived by the various races of mankind. To
speak of Chinese being “without grammar,” as Bopp
does, or to describe the larger number of languages as
inorganic or other than normal, like Schlegel and Pott,
is simply self-contradictory. Every morphological classification
of language must be founded on grammar—that
is, on the relations of the several parts of the sentence to
one another; and the very existence of a class implies
that it has a grammar and an organic life. We shall
never have a satisfactory starting-point for our classification
unless we put both word and root out of sight, and
confine ourselves to the sentence or proposition, and
the ways in which the sentence may be expressed. The
reason why languages differ morphologically is that the
thought which they embody assumes different forms.</p>

<p>In the second chapter (pp. 122-132) the languages of the
world have been classed as (1) polysynthetic, (2) isolating,
(3) incorporating, (4) agglutinative, (5) inflectional,
and (6) analytic, and reason shown from the structure of
the sentence why such a classification should be made.
Steinthal was the first to make the sentence rather than
the word the basis of morphological arrangement, and to
point out that where we are dealing with grammar and
structure, we must have at least two words standing in
grammatical relation to each other. Steinthal’s system
is very elaborate. He begins with the division of language
into formless and formal, a division, however, of
very questionable accuracy. It seems to take us back to
the scheme of Schlegel, and to forget that where languages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
are distinguished from one another by the forms
they assume, we cannot describe any of them as having
no form at all. The form of speech, indeed, is the mode
in which the mind views the connection between the
several parts of a proposition, so that wherever we have
a proposition, wherever, in fact, we have language, there
must be form. Steinthal, however, goes on to divide his
formless languages into “juxta-positive” and “compositive,”
the Taic languages belonging to the first, and
the Polynesian, Ural-Altaic, and American belonging to
the second. The formal languages are similarly divided
into “juxta-positive” and “compositive,” Chinese coming
under the head of the one and Old Egyptian, Semitic,
and Aryan coming under that of the other.</p>

<p>Humboldt did better than Steinthal in using the terms
“imperfect” and “perfect,” instead of “formless” and
“formal.” Like Steinthal, he classed Chinese along with
the inflectional languages of Europe, rather than with
Burman and the other isolating idioms of the far East.
This seems most unnatural, since—so far as outward form
is concerned—little difference can be made between isolating
Chinese and isolating Burman. It is true that
the order in which the parts of the sentence follow one
another is more or less free in Chinese, while it is fixed
in Burman, but this is a difference essentially unlike that
between inflectional Aryan with its suffixes and inflectional
Semitic with its internal vowel-change. Besides,
both Aryan and Semitic are included in the same
class. But both Humboldt and Steinthal found themselves
in a difficulty. Starting with the assumption that
all language follows a regular course of development,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
ascending from the isolating stage to the inflectional,
they had further to assume that this development was
but a reflection of the general development of the mind,
and that the passage from one stage of speech to the
other was marked by a passage to a higher intelligence
and a higher form of civilization. How, then, could it be
possible that the Chinese nation, which seems to have
originated a considerable civilization, should show no
signs of that civilization in its language, the mirror and
reflection of the spirit of man? How could it be that
the language spoken by the primitive Aryans, when they
were still simple shepherds on the Hindu-Kush, before
they had learnt the elements of writing and culture from
their Semitic neighbours, was so much in advance of that
of a race to whom belonged the hard task of initiating
a civilization? The only escape from the difficulty was
to deny that Chinese should be classed with Burman, in
spite of appearances, and so to throw the whole system
of classification into confusion.</p>

<p>For that system depends upon the mode in which the
grammatical relations of the sentence are expressed, and
so long as the mode is the same, the order followed by
the several parts of the sentence matters but little. The
order of words, in fact, is constantly liable to change,
and the simple fact that the definite article is postfixed
in Scandinavian, Albanian, Bulgarian, and Wallachian,
while it is prefixed in those other members of the Aryan
family which possess one, shows how impossible it is to
ground any important conclusions upon it. The same
language varies from age to age in the position it assigns
to the words it uses. The modern <i>moreover</i>, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
appears as <i>overmore</i> in the Paston letters, and the Coptic,
once a postfix language, has now become a prefix one.
As we shall see presently, the order assumed by the
parts of the sentence depends in great measure upon the
development of grammatical forms.</p>

<p>Humboldt and Steinthal, nevertheless, are quite right
in believing that there is a distinction between Chinese
and Burman, but the distinction is that between a decrepit
and civilized language on the one hand and a
fresh and uncultivated language on the other. Chinese
civilization is immensely old, and the language which
enshrines it is immensely old also; but we must be on
our guard against supposing that the antiquity of
Chinese is proved by its isolating character. Chinese
is no example of arrested growth, no fossilized relic of
an earlier condition of speech. Were it so, Chinese
civilization, and the originality and progress it implies,
would be inexplicable. When we compare classical
Chinese with Burman or Siamese, or even with the
less cultivated dialects of the Chinese empire itself, we
find the progress and development we should expect;
but it is progress and development within the limits of
“isolation.” All the possibilities of the isolating sentence
have been worked out; and if these possibilities
are not so numerous or so adequate as in the case of an
agglutinative or inflectional sentence, the fault is due to
the original conception of the sentence with which the
Chinese started, not to fossilization or arrested growth.
The Mandarin dialect of China has been affected by
phonetic decay to an enormous extent; numerous sounds
have perished, and words once dissimilar have become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
identical in pronunciation. By the help of the ancient
rhymes, of the cognate dialects, and of a scientific examination
of the written characters, Dr. Edkins has been
able to restore the pronunciation of Chinese as it was
two thousand and more years ago, and the evidences thus
obtained of the wear and tear of the speech are most
striking. <i>Dak</i>, “the flute,” for instance, has become <i>yo</i>;
<i>zhet</i>, “the tongue,” is now <i>she</i> and the table of correspondent
sounds given in the foot-note will show how
great has been the changes undergone by the outward
form of the cultivated language.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Side by side with this
decay of sounds went a corresponding grammatical development.
Tones were introduced to distinguish words
that had come to be pronounced alike, and the different
parts of the sentence were marked out by “empty
words,” used like our “of” or “if” in a purely symbolical
and grammatical sense. It is probable that the spread
of education and the extensive employment of ideographic
writing had much to do with the phonetic decay
that attacked the language. Ambiguities in conversation
could always be remedied by an appeal to written symbols.
At all events, it is curious that Accadian was
almost equally affected by phonetic decay; and Accadian
not only possessed a similarly ideographic system
of writing, but was spoken in a country where education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
was similarly widespread, and clay—the ordinary writing
material—was always at hand.</p>

<p>We are apt to assume that inflectional languages are
more highly advanced than agglutinative ones, and agglutinative
languages than isolating ones, and hence that
isolation is the lowest stage of the three, at the top of
which stands flection. But what we really mean when
we say that one language is more advanced than another,
is that it is better adapted to express thought, and that
the thought to be expressed is itself better. Now, it is a
grave question whether from this point of view the three
classes of language can really be set the one against the
other. So long as thought is expressed clearly and intelligibly,
it does not much matter how it is expressed—how,
that is, the relations of the sentence or proposition
are denoted. When we begin to contrast the morphology
of two classes of speech, there is a tendency to import
our prejudices into the question, and to assume that the
grammatical forms to which we have been accustomed
are necessarily superior to those which appear strange to
us. The masterpieces of Greek, or Latin, or Sanskrit
literature have produced the impression that the languages
which embody them must surpass all others as
instruments of thought. But such an impression may,
after all, be an incorrect one. English literature stands
on quite as high a level as the literature of the classical
tongues. The English language is quite as good an instrument
of thought as Sanskrit or Greek, and yet English
can hardly be said to be inflectional in the way that
Sanskrit and Greek are. If we turn to China we shall
find the Chinaman preferring his own classics to anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
produced by the West, and regarding his own
language as the best possible instrument of thought.
Preferences of this kind can as little be referred to an
absolute standard as preferences in the matter of personal
beauty. The European, for instance, has a wholly
different ideal of beauty from the Negro, and the Negro
from the Mongol. If the excellence of a language is to
be decided by the number and variety of its grammatical
forms, the palm will be borne off rather by the Eskimaux
or the Cheroki than by the dialects of Greece
and Rome; if by the attainment of terseness and vividness,
Chinese will come to the front; if by clearness and
perspicacity, English will dispute the prize with the
agglutinative languages. Indeed, the agglutinative languages
are in advance of the inflectional in one important
point, that, namely, of analyzing the sentence into its
component parts, and distinguishing the relations of
grammar one from another. It has been remarked<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> that
“were the development theory true, the inflectional
would have developed into the agglutinative, and not the
converse.” Thought is obscured, not assisted, by the
existence of different terminations to express the same
grammatical relation, or of the same termination to express
different grammatical relations; and yet this is an
anomaly and source of confusion which continually meets
us in the inflectional tongues. The ascription of gender
to inanimate objects is worthy only of a savage and unreasoning
age, and where the signs of gender have lost
all reference to their original import, as in modern German,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
they become merely a relic and survival of barbarism.
In fact, when we examine closely the principle
upon which flection rests, we shall find that it implies an
inferior logical faculty to that implied by agglutination.
In a flectional language the relations of the sentence are
denoted by particular suffixes or internal vowel-changes,
which group themselves, as it were, round the principal
thought contained in the sentence. In other words,
every subordinate thought should be denoted by a flection.
Such a principle, however, cannot be worked.
<i>Amabit</i>, it is true, means “he will love;” but in order to
express “he must love,” language has to break through
its flectional principle and denote the idea, not by flection,
but by independent words—<i>necesse est ut amet</i>, or
<i>illi amandum est</i>. But this is not the only mode in
which the principle of flection is violated by the necessities
of developed speech. When sentences come to be
brought into relation with one another, the subordinate
sentence ought to be pointed out by flectional means.
This is done in some cases, as in the Greek use of the
inflected article with the infinitive. Generally, however,
the subordination is left to be marked by independent
words, such as the conjunctions, by the very means, in
fact, adopted by Chinese and other isolating languages
in accordance with their fundamental principle. In fact,
the principle of flection cannot be logically carried out
beyond the narrow circle of those simple sentences which
sufficed for the needs and intelligence of primitive man,
and the progress of thought in modern Europe has been
marked by a corresponding revolt from the trammels of
flection. It is only dialects like those of Slavs and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
Lithuanians which still cling to an elaborate system of
flection. English has fitted itself to become a universal
language by struggling to assimilate its condition to that
of Chinese. Even the polysynthetic languages of America
can, with a certain show of reason, claim a higher
place for themselves than inflectional speech. If the
object of language is to express thought, it is obvious
that that thought should be expressed as a whole, as in
a picture; and this is just what is done by a polysynthetic
sentence. Our own language, when it forms such
compound epithets as “The Employers’ Liability for Injury
Bill,” or German when it interpolates a whole sentence
between the article and its substantive, virtually
adopt the principle of polysynthetism. Polysynthetism,
however, is only to be preferred when we wish to represent
our thought as a single whole, to bring it before the
mind of another just as it presents itself to our own
mind. The best test we really have of a growth in intelligence
and reasoning power is an increasing clearness and
analysis of thought. The polysynthetic languages are
essentially the languages of races whose logical faculties
are backward, or who have not yet left behind them the
“jelly-fish” stage of development.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Division of labour,
differentiated organization, analysis of thought and its
expression—all these are the signs of advancing civilization.</p>

<p>The whole picture is imaged in the mind before we
break it up into its several parts. So, too, the sentence
which embodied a thought was conceived as a whole
before it was separated into its elements. Gestures were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
the first makeshift for grammar; they determined the relations
of each particular utterance. Then these utterances
came to be compared together, and those that agreed
were put on one side, and those that disagreed on another.
By slow degrees the relations of grammar were thus
evolved; gestures became more and more unnecessary,
until at last in the most highly cultivated languages, such
as modern English, they have disappeared almost entirely
or been banished from educated speech. But this
primitive monad, this undifferentiated sentence-word,
developed very variously in the mouths of different
speakers. In one case a number of antecedent circumstances
combined to produce a certain conception of the
outer world and the relation of things to each other and
to the mind, altogether unlike the conception which grew
up in other cases. Here the Chinaman regarded the
elements of the sentence as co-ordinate and equal, setting
part against part, and member against member, and
leaving the relations between them to be supplied by the
mind. There the Mongol drew a hard and fast distinction
between the principal and the subordinate, between
the nucleus of the proposition and the ideas dependent
on it, but he took care to express each by a corresponding
word and to place these words in the exact relation
demanded by the thought. Elsewhere, again, the Hindu
merged the subordinate in the principal, expressing the
relations of the several parts of the sentence by modifications
of the individual words or imitating the original
form of speech by a long and elaborate compound. But
in all cases the developed sentence of the later period
would seem to have been evolved out of the primitive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
undifferentiated one according to the genius of the
speakers and the mode in which they conceived the relations
of ideas. The American tongues alone preserved
a semblance of the form once assumed by all speech,
and in the compounds of the inflected idioms we may
also trace a reflection of the earliest utterances of man.
What these were may still be gathered from the grammar
of the Eskimaux, even though there is as great a
gap between this and the primæval sentence-words of his
forefathers as there is between the social condition of the
Eskimaux and the social condition of his first ancestors.
A cultured language like the Mexican shows the highest
development attainable by the polysynthetic form of
speech; here words may be isolated and separated from
the sentence by means of the affix <i>tl</i>. <i>Sotsitl</i>, for instance,
is “flowers,” <i>ni-sotsi-temoa</i>, “I look for flowers.”
All over the world, indeed, wherever we come across a
savage race, or an individual who has been unaffected by
the civilization surrounding him, we find the primitive
inability to separate the particular from the universal by
isolating the individual word, and extracting it, as it
were, from the ideas habitually associated with it. Thus
the Hottentot cannot use a noun without a pronominal
suffix indicating not only gender and case but also person
as well, except as a predicate;<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> in several of the South
American dialects the words which denote “head,” “body,”
“eye,” or other parts of the person, cannot be named without
personal relation being denoted by a prefixed possessive
pronoun or denied by a negative or privative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
prefix,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and in Mr. Wallace’s vocabularies from the river
Uapes this inability extends to other words. A Kurd of
the Zaza tribe who furnished Dr. Sandwith with a list
of words belonging to his dialect, was so little “able to
conceive a <i>hand</i> or <i>father</i>, except so far as they were
related to himself, or something else, and so essentially
concrete rather than abstract were his notions, that he
combined the pronoun with the substantive whenever he
had a part of the human body or a degree of consanguinity
to name,” saying <i>sèrè-min</i>, “my head,” and <i>pie-min</i>,
“my father.” Dr. Latham, from whom this fact is quoted,
goes on to refer to a similar amalgamation noticed by
him in the languages of the Louisiade and mentioned in
the appendix to Macgillivray’s “Voyage of the Rattlesnake,”
as well as in the ordinary Gipsy dialect spoken
in England.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>A morphological review of the languages of the world
reveals one curious and significant fact. Particular types
of language belong to particular localities. In other words,
a morphological classification of speech is also a geographical
one. The polysynthetic idioms are characteristic
of America, the isolating dialects of the extreme east of
Asia. So, too, the leading inflectional families of speech,
the Aryan and the Semitic, have both proceeded, it would
seem, from Western Asia, like the Alarodian family, also
inflectional, and best represented by the modern Georgian.
The prefix-pronominal languages are confined to Southern
Africa, as the incorporating Basque to the Pyrenees and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
the verbless Malayo-Polynesian to the islands of the
Pacific. This fact would go to show that the distant
emigration of languages, like the distant emigration of
races, is very exceptional and chiefly characteristic of
the higher species with their greater energy and expansiveness.
The wanderings of savage tribes are circumscribed
by the climatic and other conditions to which
they are peculiarly subject. Without canoes voyages
cannot be taken, and mountains, rivers, deserts, or
stronger neighbours are all obstacles to movement more
or less insurmountable. The fact would also go to show
that it is only within the area peculiar to a certain class
of languages that we may look for their progress and development.
It is only in Eastern Asia or in America that
we can hope to discover the highest development of
which an isolating or a polysynthetic language is capable,
and so regard Chinese and Mexican not as “arrested
growths,” but as instinct with the progressive intelligence
and cultivated life of the peoples that speak them.
Where no traces of a type of speech different from the
prevailing one are to be found, we are justified in concluding
that it never existed there. And finally the fact
will correct that tendency we all have to assume a unity
upon insufficient evidence. Types of language, like types
of race, are as strongly marked off from one another as
the countries to which they belong. Polysynthetism is
as much characteristic of America as the hatchet face and
red skin of the aboriginal; isolation of Eastern Asia as the
yellow skin and oblique eyes of the Chinaman or the
Burman. Modern discoveries are gradually producing
a conviction that the civilizations of China, of Babylonia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
and of Egypt were all independent and self-evolved.
Such at all events is the case with their modes of writing,
the best product of any civilization, and no one can
study the character of these three civilizations without
perceiving that they are radically distinct. Egypt, when
the monuments first cast light upon her some 6,000 years
ago, is in the height of her culture and advancement;
but she comes before us as a pharos of light in the midst
of utter darkness, self-contained and self-sufficient, but
surrounded on all sides by tribes and nations even more
barbarous than the untaught Negro of to-day. And such
as was the civilization, such too was the language; the
civilizations of the Nile, of the Euphrates, and of the
Hoang-ho, were not more isolated and peculiar than the
languages which embodied them. It is difficult for us
with our steamers and railways and telegraphs to realize
the separation and practical immobility of the ancient
world. Geographical barriers cut off tribe from tribe,
race from race, language from language, and war instead
of peace was the sole means that existed of overcoming
them. It is to these barriers, however, that we owe the
persistency of racial and linguistic type which we may
still note in so many parts of the world. It has often
been remarked that the fauna and flora of America take
us back to a geological rather than a historical age; the
same may also emphatically be said of the American
type of speech. The Eskimaux may or may not be the
survivor of the man of the reindeer age; his grammar, at
all events, is a relic of a bygone era of speech.</p>

<p>The morphology of speech, then, deals with the relation
of the parts of the sentence one to another. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
relation is expressed by what we term grammatical forms.
Position, it is true, as well as accent, frequently takes the
place of grammatical forms, especially in languages like
Burman or English, but in this case both position and
accent will have to be considered as belonging to the province
of morphology. The rule which in Burman makes
the first of two substantives a genitive or in English a
substantive which follows a transitive verb an accusative
is itself a grammatical form. Even in those tongues in
which the expression of grammatical relations is fullest
and most exact, there is much that can never be expressed
by outward means, but only hinted at and understood.
“The rudest of men,” says Chaignet,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> “are yet sages;
ils s’entendent à demi-mot; ils parlent par <i>sous-entendus</i>.”
“It is,” as he goes on to observe, “the gesture, the tone,
the connection of the sense or its abrupt breaking off, the
undefinable and speaking expression of the face, that
supply and complete our thought, marking its relations, or
more truly its formal side, its most spiritual element,
whereby language raises itself above mere sensation and
matter.” The structure of a language is determined not
only by the general type, isolating, agglutinative, or
otherwise, to which it conforms, but also by the mode in
which its words are linked together, by the way in which
its grammatical forms are used and connected, and by
the greater or less extent to which the quickness of
the hearer in understanding what is not expressed is
called upon. Structurally, Coptic belongs to the inflectional
class of tongues, but among these it is distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
by its prefixing its grammatical forms instead
of affixing them, as was the case with its parent the Old
Egyptian.</p>

<p>We must not forget, however, that whether in Coptic
or Old Egyptian, or any other language, the grammatical
form, the relation to be expressed, the idea to be developed
and formulated, lay quite as much in the mere
act of prefixing or affixing as in the sounds which were
prefixed or affixed. The Sanskrit <i>ad-mi</i> means “I eat,”
not only because it is a compound of a verbal stem or
root signifying “eating,” and the personal pronoun <i>mi</i>,
but because the pronoun is attached to the stem in such
a way as to convey the conception of the relation intended
to exist between the two ideas “eating” and “I.” We
may therefore lay down that one of the modes adopted
by language for denoting the relations of grammar is (1)
the attachment of prefixes or affixes which may or may
not be significant when used alone. (2) A second is the
insertion of what are called infixes, as in Dayak, where
from <i>kan</i>, “to eat,” the stem <i>k-um-an</i> comes, or in Malay,
where by the side of <i>ka-kan</i> and <i>ma-kan</i> we have also
<i>k-um-akan</i>. So, too, in Tagala we find <i>b-in-atin</i> for <i>in-batin</i>,
just as in the secondary conjugations of the Semitic
verb, <i>iphteal</i>, <i>iphtael</i>, <i>istaphal</i>, the suffix <i>ta</i> is inserted between
the first and second consonants of the root instead
of being prefixed as elsewhere. No doubt, metathesis
aided by analogy was the primary cause of this curious
phænomenon, as it is in the Sanskrit <i>yu-na-j-mi</i>, “I join,”
instead of <i>yuj-na-mi</i> corresponding with the Greek ζεύγ-νυ-μι.
The incorporating and polysynthetic languages are
examples of the principle on a large scale. (3) A third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
mode of expressing the relations of grammar is by a
change of vowel. The vowel may either pass into another
or receive a different quantity or accent. Professor
Pott refers to the use of <i>vṛiddhi</i> in Sanskrit patronymics
by way of illustration as well as to change of accent
in Greek proper names or vocatives. A difference of
vowel which was originally purely phonetic has been
adapted to distinguish between singular and plural in the
English <i>man</i> and <i>men</i>, between transitive and intransitive
in Greek verbs in -όω and -έω. Among the less cultivated
languages of the world extended use has been made of
this method of indicating the forms of grammar. In
Javanese, for instance, <i>iki</i> is “this,” <i>ika</i>, “that,” <i>iku</i>, “that
there;” in Japanese <i>ko</i> is “here,” <i>ka</i>, “there;” in Carib,
<i>ne</i> is “thou,” <i>ni</i>, “he;” in Brazilian Botocudo <i>ati</i> is “I,”
<i>oti</i>, “thou.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> In African Tumali <i>ngi</i> is “I,” <i>ngo</i>, “thou,”
and <i>ngu</i>, “her.” Even differences of signification may
be denoted by the same means; the Carib <i>baba</i>, “father,”
is contrasted with <i>bibi</i>, “mother,” just as the Mantschu
<i>chacha</i>, “man,” and <i>ama</i>, “father,” stand over against
<i>cheche</i>, “woman,” and <i>eme</i>, “mother,” or the Finnic <i>ukko</i>,
“old man,” and African Ibo, <i>nna</i>, “father,” over against
<i>akka</i>, “old woman,” and <i>nne</i>, “mother.” The numerals
have not escaped being distinguished in a similar manner;
<i>tizi</i> is “one” in Lushu, and <i>tazi</i>, “two;” “three” and
“four” are <i>ngroka</i> and <i>ngraka</i> in Koriak, <i>niyokh</i> and
<i>niyakh</i> in Kolyma, <i>gnasog</i> and <i>gnasag</i> in Karaga, and
<i>tsúk</i> and <i>tsaak</i> in Kamschatkan, while in Japanese <i>fitó</i>,
<i>mi(tsu)</i>, and <i>yo</i>, are “one,” “three,” and “four,” <i>fŭtá</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
<i>mu(tsu)</i>, and <i>yá</i>, “two,” “six,” and “eight.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The Grebo
of West Africa can distinguish between “I” and “thou,”
“we” and “you,” solely by the intonation of the voice,
<i>mâ di</i> being equally “I eat” and “thou eatest,” <i>a di</i>,
“you” and “we eat,” and in Bâ-ntu Mpongwe <i>tŏnda</i>
means “to love,” <i>tōnda</i>, “not to love.”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> (4) An internal
change of consonant will be the next mode adopted by
language of marking a grammatical idea. Thus in Burman
the active is distinguished from the passive or neuter
by aspirating an unaspirated consonant, <i>kya</i>, for instance,
being “to fall,” but <i>khya</i>, “to throw,” <i>pri</i>, “to be full,”
<i>phri</i>, “to fill.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> (5) Fifthly, position may be the determining
mark of relations of grammar, as is so pre-eminently
the case in Chinese and the Taic languages.
It makes a good deal of difference in English whether
we say, “The man killed the dog,” or “The dog killed
the man.” (6) Another determining mark is reduplication,
which is common to all the languages of the world
though used to express very different grammatical ideas.
Sometimes it may denote a past tense, as in Aryan (δέδωκα,
<i>cecidi</i>, <i>did</i>, &amp;c.); sometimes a plural, as in the Bushman
<i>tu-tu</i>, “mouths,” the Sonorian <i>qui-qui</i>, “houses,” or the
Malay <i>raja-raja</i>, “princes;” sometimes a collective, as
in the Canarese <i>nîru gîru</i>, “water and the like;” sometimes
a superlative, as in the Accadian <i>gal-gal</i>, “very
great,” the Mandingo <i>ding-ding</i>, “a very little child,” or
the French <i>beaucoup-beaucoup</i>, “very much;” sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
continuous action, as in the Dayak <i>kaká-kaka</i>, “to go
on laughing loud,” or the Tamil <i>muru-muru</i>, “to murmur;”
sometimes intensity, as in the Sanskrit <i>upary-upari</i>,
“higher and higher,” the Greek παμ-φαίνω, “to shine
brightly,” or the Dayak <i>ku lyang ku lyang</i>, “to think
deeply;” sometimes emphasis and asseveration, as in the
Dayak <i>kwai kwai</i>, “very strange!” <i>shi shi</i>, “yes, yes;”
sometimes frequentative or repeated action, as in the
Brazilian <i>acêm</i>, “I go out,” <i>ace-acêm</i>, “I go out frequently,”
<i>oce-cem</i>, “they go out one after the other.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
The reduplication is often a broken one, that is, only the
first syllable or part of a syllable is reduplicated, as in
the Latin <i>mo-mordi</i> for <i>mor-mordi</i>. Broken reduplication
is very common in the Aryan languages, but Brugman<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
has shown reason for believing that it has arisen out of
an earlier complete reduplication through the action of
phonetic decay. Now and then the reduplication takes
place in the middle of a word, as in the Sonorian Tepeguana
where some plurals are formed by repeating the second
syllable, as in <i>aliguguli</i>, “boys,” from <i>alguli</i>, “boy,” or a
medial syllable, as in <i>hiim</i>, “gourds,” and <i>googosi</i>, “dogs,”
from the singulars <i>him</i> and <i>gogosi</i>.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Instead of the first
syllable, only the initial vowel of a word may undergo
reduplication; thus in Tepeguana <i>ali</i>, “child,” is <i>a-ali</i> in
the plural, <i>ogga</i>, “father,” is <i>o-ogga</i>, <i>ubi</i>, “woman,” is
<i>u-ubi</i>. On the other hand, a word may be lengthened by
the repetition of the vowel at the end, as well as in the
middle; the Botocudos of Brazil, for instance, turn <i>uatu</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
“a stream,” into <i>uatu-u-u-u</i>, “ocean;” with the Aponegricans
“six” is <i>itawuna</i>, “seven,” <i>itawu-ú-una</i>, while the
Madagascar <i>ratchi</i>, “bad,” becomes <i>ra-a-atchi</i>, “very
bad.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> When whole words are reduplicated a change
may be made in the initial consonant of the second part
of the reduplication; thus in Canarese the initial consonant
becomes the guttural <i>g</i>, as in the example quoted
above, and the French <i>pêle-mêle</i> and English <i>hurdy-gurdy</i>
are familiar instances of the same fact. Sir John
Lubbock<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> has made an interesting calculation of the
proportion of reduplicated words found in English,
French, German, and Greek on the one side, and some of
the barbarous languages of Africa, America, and the
Pacific on the other, the result being that whereas “in
the four European languages we get about two reduplications
in about 1,000 words, in the savage ones the number
varies from 38 to 170, being from twenty to eighty times
as many in proportion.” Reduplication, in fact, is one
of the oldest contrivances of speech. It is largely employed
by children in their first attempts to speak, and
we need not, therefore, be surprised at finding it so persistently
holding its ground both in the nursery and
among barbarous tribes. The Polynesians seem to have
a special affection for it, though on the other hand, Mr.
Matthews tells us that in North America while reduplication
is a prominent feature of the Dakota verb it occurs
in only one verb in the closely allied Hidacha dialect.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
Reduplication, however, is one of the most important
modes adopted by language for denoting the relations of
grammar; it is, in fact, one of the most obvious and
natural of its outward means of expressing those inward
forms and grammatical conceptions which the human
intelligence has painfully struggled to realize.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>The common division of speech into formal and material
is at once defective and misleading. The articulate
sounds of which words are composed may indeed be
called their matter, but they do not become words, do
not constitute a part of speech until they have thought
and significancy breathed into them like the breath of
life into man. This significancy is a relative one, that is
to say, the meaning of a word depends upon its relation
to some other. But this relation may be of two kinds,
it may exist either between the ideas denoted by the
words or between the words when coupled together in
some particular sentence. In the first case we have to
do with sematology, in the second with grammar. We
can understand what is meant by the word <i>tree</i> only by
comparing and contrasting the idea of <i>tree</i> with other
cognate ideas; but the relation between <i>tree</i> and <i>sheds</i>
in such a sentence as “the tree sheds its leaves,” is of a
totally different nature. The idea of <i>tree</i> remains the
same whatever be the outward symbol by which it is
expressed, whether <i>tree</i>, or <i>arbor</i>, or <i>baum</i>, or anything
else; the relation between <i>tree</i> and <i>sheds</i> is one that can
be discovered only by a historical and comparative investigation
of English grammar. It is to this grammatical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
relation alone that the term <i>formal</i> is strictly applicable;
it has to do with the forms, or, as in the instance before
us, the want of forms, whereby the relations of grammar,
the relations, that is, of words in a sentence, are denoted.
Going back to the primitive sentence-word, we shall have
to distinguish between the material sounds of which it
was composed, the meaning it always possessed whenever
and however used, and the form (or position) that
it assumed according to the occasion on which it was
used. The child who says “Up!” always attaches the
same signification to the general idea contained in the
word, but whether it is to be regarded as an imperative,
a hortative, an optative, or any other particular grammatical
form is left to the context, the tone and gesture,
or the intelligence of the bearer. Language consists of
the material, the significant, and the formal, and it is
only the latter, that part of language, in fact, the origin
of which we have elsewhere traced to gesture, that
properly concerns morphology.</p>

<p>Whatever, therefore, belongs to grammar belongs also
to morphology. Not only general form and structure,
but also grammar in the narrower sense of the word, as
well as composition, and what our German neighbours
term “word-building” must be included under it. Composition,
indeed, is but a species of declension and conjugation.
<i>Parricida</i> and <i>patris (oc)cisor</i>, φερέοικος and οἶκον
φέρει, have exactly the same force and meaning. The
only difference between <i>good-for-nothing</i> as a compound
and “he is good for nothing” in a complete sentence, is
that the first can be used as an attribute. The ordinary
genitive of the Semitic tongues, the so-called “construct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
state,” is really an instance of composition, the first noun—that
which “governs” the second—being pronounced
in a single breath with the other, and accordingly losing
the case-terminations. This did not happen originally,
as may be seen from the occasional occurrence of these
terminations even in Assyrian, which is more strict in following
out the rule than any other of the cognate idioms.
The power of composition is greater in some languages
than in others. The polysynthetic sentences of an
American dialect present the appearance of gigantic
compounds, with this difference, however, that in a true
compound the language has put together two words that
have already been used independently, or at all events
are capable of being used independently, whereas in the
less advanced American languages the several members
of the sentence have never attained the rank of independent
words which can be set apart and employed by
themselves. Even in some of the compounds of the
Aryan family, where the flectionless “stem” shows itself,
it may be questioned whether we have not before us the
relics of that earliest stage of speech when the flections
had not yet been evolved, and when the relations of
grammar were expressed by the close amalgamation of
flectionless stems in a single sentence-word. However
that may be, the power of forming compounds possessed
by the Aryan group of languages stands in marked contrast
to the repugnance felt by the Semitic tongues in
this respect. Composition is as rare in Semitic as it is
common in Aryan, and this contrast between the two
families of speech is one of the many that demonstrate
the radical difference existing between them. Perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
extended use made by the Semitic languages of denoting
the relations of grammar by internal vowel-change had
much to do with their objection to the employment of
compounds. They are less agglutinative in character
than the Aryan dialects, truer, in fact, to the principle of
flection, and the same instinct that makes them represent
the ideas of “killing” and “a killing” by <i>kodhêl</i> and
<i>kidhl</i> (<i>kedhel</i>), rather than by <i>trucida-n-s</i> and <i>trucida-ti-o(n)</i>,
makes them also use two unallied roots like <i>hâlach</i>
and <i>yâtsâ</i> where the Aryan would have said <i>ire</i> and <i>exire</i>.
Even within the Aryan family itself we find the
Greek with compounds like the comic λεπαδο-τεμαχο-σελαχο-γαλεο-κρανιο-λειψανο-δριμ-υπο-τριμματο-σιλφιο-παραο-μελιτο-κατα-κεχυμενο-κιχλ-επι-κοσσυφο-φαττο-περι-στερ-αλεκτρυον-οπτ-εγ-κεφαλο-κιγκλο-πελειο-λαγῳο-σιραιο-βαλη-τραγανο-πτερύγων,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and the Latin
comparatively poor in them, while modern English, in
spite of the loss of its flections, lags but little behind
German. Russian can form such specimens of agglutination
as <i>bezbozhnichestvovat</i>, “to be in the condition of
being a godless person,” from <i>bez Boga</i>, “without God,”
and classical Sanskrit almost dispenses with syntax by
its superabundant use of composition. Where syntax
is highly developed, as it was in Latin, the growth of
composition is checked and limited.</p>

<p>Composition has been a fruitful source of grammatical
flection, and a still more fruitful source of what is meant
by “word-building.” It is highly probable that the person-endings
of the Aryan verb <i>as-mi</i>, <i>a(s)-si</i>, <i>as-ti</i>, or ἐσ-μι, ἐσ-σι,
ἐσ-τι, are but the personal pronouns closely compounded
with the verbal stem. Such, certainly, has been the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
with the so-called <i>tempus durans</i> of Aramaic, where
<i>kâdhêlnâ</i>, “I am killing,” is resolvable into <i>kâdhêl</i> + <i>’anâ</i>,
“killing + I,” and <i>kâdhlath</i>, “thou art killing,” into <i>kâdhêl</i>
+ <i>at’</i>, “killing + thou.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The Latin imperfect and
future in -<i>bam</i> and -<i>bo</i> seem to be compounds of the
verbal stem with the verb <i>fuo</i>, “to exist,”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> like the perfect
in -<i>ui</i> or -<i>vi</i> (<i>fui</i>), while the pluperfect <i>scripseram</i> is
a combination of <i>eram</i> or <i>esam</i> and the perfect <i>scripsi</i>
(itself formed from the verbal stem <i>scrib</i>- and the old
perfect <i>esi</i> of the substantive verb “sum”). So, too, the
form <i>amavissem</i> is just as much a compound of <i>amavi</i>
(<i>ama</i> + <i>fui</i>) and <i>essem</i> (<i>es</i> + <i>siem</i>) as is <i>amatus sum</i> of the
passive participle and the substantive verb. If we turn
to our own language we can trace our perfects in -<i>ed</i>
back to the Gothic amalgamation of the verb with <i>dide</i>,
the reduplicated perfect of the verb <i>do</i>, while the origin
of the French <i>aimerai</i> in the infinitive <i>aimer</i> (<i>amare</i>) and
the auxiliary <i>ai</i> (<i>habeo</i>) is as plain as that of the Italian
<i>dármelo</i> (“to give it to me”) or <i>fáteglielo</i> (“do it for
him”). The real character of the compound has come to
be forgotten in course of time, and its final part has
gradually lost all semblance of independence and been
assimilated to the terminations which simply denote
grammatical relations. The general analogy of the language
has been too strong for it, and the agglutinated
word has become a flection.</p>

<p>But there are many suffixes which are not flections—that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
is to say, which do not denote the relations of
grammar, or rather the relations that exist between the
different parts of the sentence. In <i>I loved</i> for <i>I love-did</i>
the grammatical relation which we name a perfect tense,
is not really expressed by the suffixed word <i>did</i>, but by
the reduplication which that word has undergone. It
was the reduplication that gave <i>did</i> (<i>dide</i>) the force of a
perfect, and the attachment of <i>did</i> to another verb merely
handed on to the latter the perfect force which it already
possessed. Strictly speaking the suffix -<i>ed</i> is a flection
only because it is the relic of a reduplication, the flection—that
is to say, the expression of a grammatical relation—lying
in the reduplication or <i>form</i> of the word. So,
too, when we find <i>dêv-mã</i>, meaning “in God,” in Gujerati,
or <i>andhê-mẽ</i>, meaning “in the blind,” in Hindustani,
we must not suppose that the locative sense actually lies
in the suffixes <i>mã</i> and <i>mẽ</i>. These suffixes go back to
the Sanskrit <i>madhyê</i>, “in the middle,” where the flection
is to be sought in the termination <i>i</i> (contained in <i>ê</i> = <i>a</i> + <i>i</i>)
not in the stem <i>madhya</i>, “middle.”</p>

<p>When, then, we say that composition may be a fruitful
source of flection, what we mean is this. Flection is the
means adopted by a certain class of languages for expressing
the relations that exist between the members of
a sentence, but a perception of these relations must first
grow up in the mind before external means are found
for embodying them. The idea of past time must be
arrived at and realized before the simple process of reduplication
can be adopted to denote it. Not only in
other languages but also in the Aryan family of speech
reduplication serves to represent other relations of grammar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
than that of past time. When the Frenchman says
<i>beaucoup beaucoup</i>—meaning “very much”—he is employing
reduplication to express the superlative relation
just as much as the old Accadian with his <i>galgal</i>, “very
great,” while the very fact that there are Greek presents
like δίδωμι and τίθημι, ought to show that there was once
a time in the history of Aryan speech when reduplication
served other purposes than that of denoting past
time. So it is with all the rest of the grammatical machinery
which we call flection. First of all the growing
intelligence came to have, as it were, an intuition of
certain relations between the parts of a sentence, and
then sounds and forms already existing were adapted to
denote these. And the very same form might at successive
periods in the development of a language be
adapted to denote different relations, as we have just
seen was the case with reduplication. When suffixes
were used for a similar purpose, they too had to follow
the general analogy. Many of these suffixes seem coeval
with the beginnings of Aryan speech, at least so far as
we know anything about it, but others of them, like the
person-endings of the verb, are really instances of composition,
the final part of the compound having become
a mere suffix, and so, like many other suffixes, been
adapted to the use of flection.</p>

<p>This brings us to those suffixes which have never been
applied to a purely flectional purpose. If we turn over
the pages of an English dictionary we shall come across
the two familiar words <i>knowledge</i> and <i>wedlock</i>, which at
first sight seem to have nothing in common. On tracing
them back to earlier forms, however, we find that <i>knowledge</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
Old English <i>know-leche</i>, like <i>wed-lock</i>, Old English
<i>wed-lâc</i>, are both compounded with the Anglo-Saxon <i>lâc</i>,
“sport” or “gift,” the Old High German <i>leih</i>, the Old
Norse <i>leikr</i>, and the Gothic <i>láiks</i>. The word still survives
in the north of England under the form of <i>laik</i>, “to
play,” and the provincial <i>lake-fellow</i> is merely “play-fellow.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
Several abstracts were formed in Anglo-Saxon
by the help of it; thus we have <i>feoht-lâc</i>, “fight,” <i>gudh-lâc</i>,
“battle,” <i>bryd-lâc</i>, “marriage,” <i>reaf-lâc</i>, “robbery.”</p>

<p>Now what has happened in the case of the English <i>lâc</i>
has happened in the case of a good number of other
words in all the languages spoken throughout the world.
Words originally independent and distinct become so
glued together in composition that one of them loses its
personal identity, as it were, and comes to be the mere
shadow of the other, whose meaning it qualifies and
classifies. Thus, for instance, the Greek κατὰ, when compounded
with the verb ἄγω, “to lead,” limits the sense of
the latter to “leading down,” and our own <i>hood</i> or <i>head</i>,
the Anglo-Saxon <i>hâd</i>, “a state,” in words like <i>Godhead</i>
or <i>maidenhood</i>, refers the nouns to which it is attached to
a new and particular class.</p>

<p>Besides flectional suffixes, then, classificatory or formative
suffixes also may ultimately be due to the process
of composition. Upon them, too, analogy will have
worked its influence, assimilating them to the other
suffixes which in course of time they had come to resemble.
When composition had once reduced a word to
the condition of a mere adjunct of another word, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
was no reason why it should not be put to the same
uses as other similar adjuncts. When the root <i>bhar</i>,
“to bear,” in such Latin compounds as <i>leti-fer</i> could
no longer be distinguished from the suffix -<i>tio(n)</i> in
words like <i>na-tio</i>, it was naturally treated in the same
way.</p>

<p>But it does not follow, as a good number of writers on
language have assumed, that because some of the classificatory
suffixes are examples of composition, all of them
are so, any more than in the case of flection and the
flectional suffixes. Indeed, we have only to glance at the
numerous suffixes employed by our own Aryan family
of speech in forming or “building” words to see how
impossible it would be to trace back a large proportion
of them to independent words. How, for instance, could
we claim any such origin for the suffixes -<i>la</i>- and -<i>ra</i>- in
<i>querela</i> and λαμπρὸς, or the suffixes -<i>ana</i>-, -<i>na</i>, and -<i>an</i> in
<i>pecten</i>, <i>donum</i>, and ἱκανός? With such suffixes all we can
do is to watch the changes they have undergone, or
caused other sounds to undergo, through the action of
phonetic decay and false analogy. Thus in Latin where
the combination <i>sr</i> changes into the softer <i>br</i>, stems like
<i>ceres</i> (Sanskrit <i>śiras</i>), “head,” and <i>fes</i> (as in <i>festus</i>) have
turned into <i>cerebrum</i> and <i>Februus</i> when combined with
the suffix -<i>ra</i>; and if we take the suffix <i>as</i> itself, we shall
find its sibilant passing into <i>r</i> before another vowel, and
so originating a long series of curious transformations.
The <i>r</i> which we get in the genitive of <i>temporis</i> was transferred
by analogy to the nominative also, where no vowel
followed it, and though there was a struggle at first between
the twin forms in <i>s</i> and <i>r</i>, traces of which survive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
in the twin <i>arbos</i> and <i>arbor</i>, the later and incorrect form
with <i>r</i> finally carried the day, and classical Latin knows
only of a <i>sopor</i>, not a <i>sopos</i>. But it may be asked why
should the penultimate syllable of <i>sopōris</i> be long whereas
it is short in <i>tempŏris</i> and <i>arbŏris</i>, and why, too, should
<i>sopor</i> be masculine while <i>tempus</i> is neuter? Here, again,
false analogy has been at work. A certain number of
masculine nouns terminating in -<i>tor</i> and denoting agents,
like <i>dator</i> or <i>victor</i>, existed in the language, and when
<i>sopos</i> was changed to <i>sopor</i>, it was assimilated to these
both in gender and in declension. Even <i>victor</i>, however,
had passed under the action of false analogy. When we
compare the Latin <i>victor</i> with <i>pater</i>, or the Greek σωτήρ
with πατήρ, it is at once clear that we are dealing in each
case with the same suffix, although in <i>victor</i> the vowel
has been thickened into the fuller <i>o</i>. But while <i>victor</i>
and σωτήρ have a long vowel in the oblique cases, this is
not the case with the much older words <i>pater</i> and πατήρ
(accusative πατέρα). It is evident, therefore, that this long
vowel must have been a sort of after-thought; and so, in
fact, it was. First of all the vowel of the nominative was
lengthened to compensate for the loss of the final sibilant
(<i>paters</i>), and the quantity of the vowel in the nominative
was then analogically extended to the other cases as
well. How far this was from having been originally the
case may be gathered from another form of the same
suffix which we have in the Sanskrit <i>patram</i>, the Greek
πτέρον, and the Latin <i>ara-tr-um</i>. Here the vowel between
the two consonants of the suffix has disappeared altogether,
as it has also in words like the Latin <i>sæclum</i> for
<i>sæ-culu-m</i>, or the Gothic <i>nê-thla</i>, our <i>needle</i>, where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
suffix, in spite of the change it has suffered, really goes
back to <i>tar</i>. The latter group of words (in <i>tar</i>), however,
is distinguished from the former (in <i>trum</i>) in both signification
and gender, the masculine agent being replaced
by a neuter noun of instrumentality. We can easily see
how such a transition of meaning must have come about.
The agent presupposes the act just as much as the act
presupposes the agent. Agent and act, in fact, are co-relative
terms, and the parent-Aryan distinguished them,
not by the classificatory suffix—for they both belonged
to the same class—but by the flectional suffix, which was
in the one case -<i>s</i> in the nominative singular, and in the
other -<i>m</i>. The Latin <i>trucidator</i> and the English <i>murder</i>
(formerly <i>murther</i>, like <i>slaugh-ter</i> and <i>laugh-ter</i>) have
precisely the same suffix, and it is only a recollection of
the difference in meaning in the flectional suffixes which
has survived their loss that prevents them from being
used with the same signification. Even these flectional
suffixes themselves—as we shall see hereafter—did not
originally imply that difference of meaning to the expression
of which they were afterwards adapted. In
nouns like the Latin <i>virus</i> or the Sanskrit <i>śiras</i>-, the
final sibilant denoted a neuter rather than a masculine or
a feminine, while <i>servum</i> or <i>humum</i> show that the final
labial might characterize the objective case of both
masculine and feminine nouns.</p>

<p>The suffix <i>tar</i> (<i>ter</i>) brings us back to those classificatory
suffixes which trace their descent from independent
words, if, as is very probable, we have to connect it
with the root found in our <i>through</i>, the Latin <i>trans</i> and
<i>ter-minus</i>, the Zend <i>tarô</i>, “across,” the Sanskrit <i>tar-âmi</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
“I pass over,” and perhaps, too, the numeral <i>tri</i>, <i>tres</i>, <i>three</i>.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
It is not difficult to understand how a word signifying
“to go through with a thing,” could be taken to form
nouns of agency. What more suitable description could
be given of “a giver” than “one who goes through with
giving,” <i>dator(s)</i>? The antiquity of this use of the suffix
in our family of speech may be gathered from the fact
that it is employed to form those nouns of relationship
which are the first to require a name. <i>Brother</i>, <i>sister</i>,
<i>daughter</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>father</i>, all contain this ancient suffix.
<i>Brother</i> (<i>bhrâ-tar</i>) is “the bearer,” from the root <i>bhar</i>,
<i>daughter</i>, “the milker” or rather “sucker,” from the root
<i>dugh</i>, while the Sanskrit grammarians derive <i>father</i>
(<i>pitar</i>) and <i>mother</i> (<i>mâtar</i>) from the roots <i>pâ</i> and <i>mâ</i>,
which respectively mean “to defend” and “to create.”
It is obvious, however, that both “father” and “mother”
must have received names long before it was necessary
to speak of “going across” or “passing through,” and
that our Aryan ancestors would not have waited to compound
two words together before giving names to the
nearest and dearest of relationships. As a matter of fact,
in almost all languages names have been found for the
parent in the two simple labial utterances <i>pa</i> and
<i>ma</i>; and the identity of these with the Aryan roots <i>pâ</i>
and <i>mâ</i> must be a pure accident. What seems to have
happened in the case of our names of relationship was
this. When the Aryan family first comes before us in the
records of speech, it is as a civilized clan with a vast but
indeterminate background of unknown history lying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
behind them. They had long since entered upon what
may be termed the epithetic stage, when man discovered
that he was a poet, and began to invent epithets for the
objects about him, and to form compounds. It was at
this stage of culture and civilization that the Aryan
community coined compound epithets for <i>brother</i>, for
<i>daughter</i>, and for <i>sister</i>, which succeeded in driving out
and replacing the older words that had preceded them.
The new compounds in <i>tar</i> took the fancy of the community,
and were widely extended by the force of
analogy. The old labials which had done duty for the
ideas of “father” and “mother” followed the fashion set
by the younger names of relationship, and so just as
<i>bhrâ-tar</i> had come to signify “brother,” <i>pa-tar</i> and <i>mâ-tar</i>
came to signify “father” and “mother.”</p>

<p>Languages do not begin with composition. If the
sentence is anterior to the word, a considerable time
must elapse between the first beginnings of a language
and the piecing together of two independent words.
Isolating tongues like the Chinese or the Burman, where
so much use is made of composition in order to create
new conceptions or to define old ones, are shown by this
very fact to have passed into a decrepit stage of existence.
The epithetic stage is one far advanced in the
history of a speech; it implies poetic imagination, a certain
measure of culture and civilization, and the germs
of a mythology. The new compounds of this epithetic
stage follow the genius and analogy of the language to
which they belong. If the formation of words depends
largely on the use of suffixes, the newly coined words
will in time adapt themselves to the old rule; what were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
once independent words will become suffixes, and be
employed in exactly the same way as the other suffixes
of the language.</p>

<p>The very existence, then, of classificatory suffixes due
to composition in our Indo-European idioms implies the
existence of earlier suffixes for which we cannot claim a
similar origin. We have already seen that this is the
case with many of the suffixes which serve the purposes
of flection; though the person-endings of the verb go
back to separate words, every attempt to discover such a
derivation for the principal case-endings has ended in
failure. What is true of the case-endings is pre-eminently
true of those suffixes which are neither flectional nor
classificatory. If we analyze the Latin <i>alumnus</i>, we find
first of all the flectional suffix -<i>(u)s</i>, then the classificatory
suffix <i>mino</i>, which relegates the word to the same class of
middle participles as the Greek τυπτόμενος, and lastly, the
suffix <i>u</i>, which intervenes between the root <i>al</i> and the
classificatory suffix <i>mino</i>. We may call this <i>u</i> a “connecting-vowel,”
or “an euphonic vowel,” or anything
else we choose, but the fact remains that it is a suffix
which can be separated from the root <i>al</i>. It is a suffix,
however, which is neither flectional nor classificatory,
and may be termed secondary for want of a better name.
Secondary suffixes play an important part in our family
of speech, and just as a flectional suffix often appears as
a classificatory one, so, too, a classificatory suffix may
appear as a secondary one. If, for example, we compare
a word like <i>civitas</i> (<i>civ-i-ta-t-s</i>) with <i>sec-ta</i>, we may not
only get the secondary suffix -<i>i</i>-, following immediately
upon the root, but also a reduplication of the classificatory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
suffix <i>ta</i>, which here at least can have no classificatory
sense. We may accordingly define a secondary
suffix as one which does not refer the word of which it
forms a part to any particular class; and where we have
several classificatory suffixes amalgamated together the
first of these have generally become secondary. Thus
the English <i>songstress</i> is a combination of two suffixes,
one Saxon and the other Romanic, which equally denoted
the feminine. By the side of <i>sang-ere</i>, “the singer,”
stood in Anglo-Saxon <i>sang-estre</i>, “the songstress;” it was
only when the classificatory significance of the termination
had died out that a new one which really went back
to the Greek -ισσα through the Latin <i>issa</i> (as in <i>abbatissa</i>),
and the French -<i>esse</i> (as in <i>justesse</i>),<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> was attached to it,
and so the old classificatory suffix became a merely
secondary one. In fact, as soon as the force of a classificatory
suffix has been weakened in a word, a fresh
classificatory suffix is always ready to be attached to it,
just as children will talk of <i>more-er</i> and <i>most-est</i>, or as
Lord Brougham introduced the equally anomalous
<i>worser</i>.</p>

<p>Now these secondary suffixes play a most important
part in a large number of languages, and more especially
in our own Aryan ones. It is seldom that a classificatory
or flectional suffix can be added immediately to the
root, as in the Sanskrit <i>ad-mi</i>, “I eat;” a secondary suffix
has usually to intervene, by means of which the root is
raised to what has been variously termed a base, a theme,
or a stem. So far as the Indo-European family of speech<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
is concerned, it is probable that even such exceptions
to the general rule as that of <i>ad-mi</i> are really due to
phonetic decay, which has worn away the original stem
to a simple monosyllable, as it has done in so many
English words like <i>man</i> or <i>fall</i>. When we come to deal
with roots, we shall see good reason for believing that
they were all or for the most part once dissyllabic, and
the tendency that many children show to turn the monosyllables
of modern English into dissyllabic words may
be but an instinctive reversion to the early type of speech.
No doubt it is very possible that just as classificatory
suffixes have been changed into secondary ones, so on
the other hand secondary suffixes may have come in
course of time to assume a classificatory character. A
conspicuous example of this may be found in the suffix
<i>ya</i>, which in Greek words like φέρουσα for φερο-ντ-yα, or
δότειρα for δοτ-ερ-yα, has become a mark of the feminine
gender. A distinction of gender is by no means engrained
in the nature of things, and the majority of
spoken languages, such as most of those which are
agglutinative or isolating, know nothing at all of it.
In some idioms, those of the Eskimo, Chocktaw, Mushtogee,
and Caddo, for instance,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> the place of gender is
taken by the division of objects into animate and inanimate,
while elsewhere they are divided into rational and
irrational. In the Bâ-ntu dialects of South Africa, nouns
are separated into a number of classes, in one case as
many as eighteen, by means of prefixes which were originally
substantives like our -<i>dom</i>, -<i>ship</i>, or -<i>hood</i>; and
the agreement of the pronoun, adjective, and verb with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
the substantive is denoted by the employment of the
same suffix. Bleek has not inaptly compared these
classes of the Bâ-ntu noun with the genders of our own
family of speech. Thus if we were to take a noun like
<span class="allsmcap">I-SI</span>-<i>zwe</i>, “nation,” which belongs to the <i>si</i>-class or gender,
in order to express the sentence “our fine nation appears,
and we love it,” the Kafir would have to say <span class="allsmcap">I-SI</span>-<i>zwe</i>
<span class="allsmcap">S</span>-<i>etu</i> <span class="allsmcap">E-SI</span>-χ’<i>le</i> <span class="allsmcap">SI</span>-<i>ya-bonakala</i> <i>si</i>-<span class="allsmcap">SI</span>-<i>tanda</i>, literally “nation
ours appears, we-it-love.” Similarly the noun <span class="allsmcap">U-LU</span>-<i>ti</i>,
“stick,” would require a corresponding change of prefix
in the words in agreement with it; and the sentence
would run: <span class="allsmcap">U-LU</span>-<i>ti</i> <span class="allsmcap">LW</span>-<i>etu</i> <span class="allsmcap">O-LU</span>-χ’<i>le</i> <span class="allsmcap">LU</span>-<i>ya-bonakala</i> <i>si</i>-<span class="allsmcap">LU</span>-<i>tanda</i>.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
There are many indications that the Aryan
language, or rather the ancestor of that hypothetical
speech which we term the parent-Aryan, was once itself
without any signs of gender. We have only to turn to
Latin and Greek to see that the words which denote
“father” and “mother,” <i>pater</i> and <i>mater</i>, πατὴρ and μητὴρ,
have exactly the same termination, while so-called
diphthongal stems as well as stems in <i>i</i> (<i>ya</i>) and <i>u</i> (like
ναῦς and νέκυς, πόλις and λῖς) may be indifferently masculine
and feminine. Even stems in <i>o</i> and <i>a</i>, though the first
are generally masculine and the second generally feminine,
by no means invariably maintain the rule, and
feminines like <i>humus</i> and ὁδός or masculines like <i>advena</i>
and πολίτης show us that there was a time when these
stems also indicated no particular gender, but owed their
subsequent adaptation, the one to mark the masculine
and the other to mark the feminine, to the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
analogy. How analogy came to act seems to have been
as follows. First of all the idea of gender was suggested
by the difference between man and woman, male and
female, and, as in so many languages at the present day,
was represented not by any outward sign, but by the
meaning of the words themselves. Thus in the Hidacha
of North America we are told that “gender is distinguished
by using, for the masculine and feminine, different
words, which may either stand alone or be added
to nouns of the common gender,”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> and in the Sonorian
languages further south it can only be denoted by the
addition of words which signify “man” and “woman.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
Then when the conception of gender had once been
arrived at it was extended to other objects besides those
to which it properly belongs. The primitive Aryan had
not yet distinguished the object thought of from the
subject that thought of it; he was still in the stage of
childhood, and just as he transferred the actions and
attributes of inanimate objects to himself, so too he
transferred to them the actions and attributes of himself,
and endowed them with a life similar to his own. The
same age which saw the creation and growth of a mythology
saw also the origin of gender in nouns, and the
distinction of gender in the demonstrative pronouns, due
to their reference to animate beings, reacted on the nouns
expressive of inanimate objects to which they likewise
referred. As soon as the preponderant number of stems
in <i>o</i> in daily use had come to be regarded as masculine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
on account of their meaning, other stems in <i>o</i>, whatever
might be their signification, had to follow the general
rule and be classed as masculine nouns. How readily the
gender of a word may be determined by its termination
has been already seen in the history of the Latin stems
in -<i>os</i>. Here and there the constant use of a word with
particular pronouns or its obvious and natural meaning
resisted the common tendency, and hence the preservation
of such anomalies as ὁδός, <i>humus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and <i>advena</i> mentioned
above. The suffix <i>ya</i>, however, like the suffix -ιδ-
(as in αὐλητρίς) in Greek or the suffix -<i>ic</i>- (as in <i>victrix</i>) in
Latin, formed part of a class of words which all followed
the dominant type; neither use nor meaning interfered
with the appropriation of them all to express the feminine
gender. The accident by which the suffix was attached
to words which chiefly denoted female agents eventually
caused it to become a classificatory instead of remaining
a mere secondary suffix. But the Aryans were not
contented with only two genders, as the Semites and
some other races were. A time came when the Aryan
awoke to the consciousness that he was essentially different
from the objects about him, that the life with which
he had clothed them was really but the reflection of his
own. He began to distinguish the agent from the
patient, and to turn his middle conjugation into a passive
one. The first sign of this new-grown consciousness was
the formation of a nominative for the first personal pronoun;
<i>ego</i>, ἐγών, the Sanskrit <i>aham</i>, is a far later creation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
than the objective <i>me</i> or <i>mâ</i>, and whether it be a compound
or not, as some scholars believe, at all events it
marks the epoch when the “me” became an “I.” The
discovery had been made that a difference existed between
the nominative and the accusative. But this difference
existed only in the case of animate beings, or of
those objects which the custom of language and the
habits of thought it had produced regarded as animate;
there was another class of objects and ideas which were
beginning to require a name and yet could not be
reckoned as coming under either of the two genders
with which the language was already acquainted. The
same development of thought which had revealed the
distinction between subject and object brought with it
also the conception of abstracts or general terms. Besides
the individual trees which had long ago received
their names, the idea of “tree” itself now needed a word
to express it, and the speaker was no longer contented
with detailing his single utterances one by one, but
wanted a general term like “word” or “speech” wherein
to sum them up. And so the new class of neuter nouns
came into existence, which were really nothing more than
old accusative cases or bare stems used as nominatives
and given a separate life of their own. So far as form
goes, the Greek δένδρον and ἔπος cannot be distinguished
from λόγον and ὄπες, the Sanskrit <i>vâchas</i> representing both
ἔπος and ὄπες alike, any more than the Latin <i>regnum</i> and
<i>vulgus</i> can be distinguished from <i>dominum</i> and <i>reges</i>.
In the pronouns the bare stem in <i>t</i> or <i>d</i>, which had once
served for all cases and all genders, was set apart for
neuter nouns, and the Aryan declension was made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
complete with its encumbrance of three genders, which
it has needed the practical genius of the English language
to shake off. The further changes that took
place in the distribution of these three genders must be
described by the historical grammars of the special languages
of the Aryan family: the age came when their
original meaning and intention was as much forgotten as
that of mythology; they were looked upon as the functions
of certain suffixes which thus became classificatory, and,
as in Latin stems in -<i>as</i> or French nouns like <i>mer</i> which
owe their gender to the confusion of the plural nominative
<i>maria</i> with the singular nominative of <i>musa</i>, they became
the sport and puppet of false analogy. The mixture of
dialects which varied as to the genders they assigned to
particular nouns completed the confusion, and modern
German is an instance of a language which still clings to
an outward excrescence of speech which originated in
childish habits of thought and has now lost all sense and
reason for its existence. A mere tax upon the memory and
an embarrassment to free literary expression, it is no
wonder that German genders are a sore trial to the
children, who are sometimes several years before they
learn to use them correctly. In this respect they resemble
the Swedish peasantry, who are said to find an
equal difficulty with the genders of their own tongue.</p>

<p>The origin of gender is one of the questions belonging
to what some German scholars have termed “the metaphysics
of language.” The metaphysics of language
deals with the source and nature of grammatical ideas as
distinct from the phonetic machinery by which they are
expressed; it seeks by a comparison, firstly of cognate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
dialects and then of families of speech, to discover the
conception which lay at the bottom of such grammatical
facts as gender, number, and the like. We want to know
not merely how the relations between the several parts
of the sentence are expressed, but what those relations
actually are. The idea must exist before phonetic means
are adapted to represent it, and in order to reach it we
must scientifically trace the history of the phonetic
means. The metaphysics of speech, therefore, is but the
second branch and division of its morphology, bearing
the same relation to the inquiry into the growth and
origin of stems and suffixes and suchlike phonetic forms
of grammar that sematology does to phonology. The
morphology of language is as much concerned with
grammatical ideas as with the external form in which
they are embodied. It is these grammatical ideas more
than their phonetic embodiment that constitute the <i>structure</i>
of a tongue.</p>

<p>Let us see, for example, whether we can track the
conception of number back to its first starting-point.
Strange as it may seem there are some uncivilized languages
which make as little distinction between the singular
and the plural as we do ourselves when we use
words like <i>sheep</i>. Thus Mr. Matthews states that “Hidatsa
nouns suffer no change of form to indicate the
difference between singular and plural,”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and in the
Sonorian tongues, according to Buschmann,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> “the simple
word in the singular serves also for the plural,” while the
monosyllabic Othomi can distinguish between singular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
and plural only by the prefixed article <i>na</i> and <i>ya</i>,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and
the Amara of Africa can only say <i>fŭrŭsn ayŭhu</i>, “I have
seen horse,” leaving the hearer to decide whether the
horse is one or many. In spite of the vast length of
time during which these languages have been shaping
and perfecting themselves, the conception of number is
still so far from being consciously realized that no phonetic
means have yet been adapted or devised to express
it. If we turn to the Tumali of Africa we find in the
case of the personal pronouns <i>ngi</i>, “I,” <i>ngo</i>, “thou,” and
<i>ngu</i>, “he,” a slight advance upon this poverty of thought.
Here the plural is denoted by the postposition <i>da</i>, “with,”
so that <i>ngi-n-da</i>, “we,” is literally “(some one) with me.”
The mind has come to distinguish between itself and that
which is outside itself, to realize, in fact, that it has an
individual existence distinct from that of some one else,
and so the conception of duality is attained. At this
conception mankind stopped for a long while; indeed,
there are many races and tribes who have not even yet
passed beyond it. Wherever the so-called plural is formed
by means of reduplication—that is to say, wherever the
doubling of a thing is the furthest point of multiplicity
to which the mind can reach, there we have not yet a
true plural, but only a dual. All over the world reduplication
seems to have been the earliest contrivance for denoting
something beyond the singular, and to this day in
Bushman, as in many other savage jargons, it serves for
a plural.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The same evidence that is borne by the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
reduplicated plural is borne also by the numerals.
The aborigines of Victoria, according to Mr. Stanbridge,
“have no name for numerals above two;”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> the Puris of
South America call “three” <i>prica</i> or “many,” which is
also the original meaning of the same numeral in Bushman,
and “the New Hollanders,” says Mr. Oldfield of
the western tribes, “have no names for numbers beyond
<i>two</i>.” It is even possible, as has been already noticed,
that our own Aryan <i>tri</i>, <i>three</i>, goes back to the same root
as that of the Sanskrit <i>tar-ô-mi</i>, “I pass beyond,” and
once signified nothing more than that which is “beyond”
two. The fact that the conception of duality preceded
the conception of plurality, explains how it is that the
seemingly useless dual has been preserved in so many
languages by the side of the plural. It is a relic of a
bygone epoch, a survival, as Mr. Tylor would call it,
which tends to be more and more restricted in use until
it disappears altogether. In both Aryan and Semitic the
dual appears only as an archaic and perishing form. The
Æolic, in this as in the throwing back of the accent, the
least conservative of the Greek dialects, has lost it entirely;
the Latin keeps it merely in <i>duo</i>, <i>octo</i>, and <i>ambo</i>,
and if we pass to the Semitic idioms, the dual of the
noun is preserved only in words which denote natural
pairs like “the eyes” or “the ears,” while in the verb it
has been maintained by Arabic alone, and in some exceptional
cases by Assyrian. Language, however, did
not always proceed at once from the dual to the plural,
from the conception, that is, of limited plurality to the
conception of unlimited plurality. Many languages possess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
a trinal number, or what are called inclusive and
exclusive forms of the personal pronouns, and in one of
the Melanesian idioms, as well as in Vitian or Fijian, we
even find a quadruple number formed by the attachment
of <i>tavatz</i> or <i>tovatz</i>, “four,” to the pronouns <i>na</i>, “you,”
and <i>dra</i>, “we.”<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> In Cheroki the dual of the first person
has one form when one of two persons speaks to the
other, another form when the one speaks of the other
to a third, <i>inaluiha</i> being “we two (<i>i.e.</i> thou and I) are
tying it;” <i>awstaluiha</i>, “we two (<i>i.e.</i> he and I) are tying it.”
In Annatom, again, <i>aniyak</i> is “I,” <i>akaijan</i>, “you two + I,”
<i>ajumrau</i>, “you two - I,” <i>akataij</i>, “you three + I,” <i>aijumtaij</i>,
“you three - I.” More usually the reduplicated dual led
to a plural without the intervention of a trinal number,
or the plural was denoted by some word like “multitude”
or “heap,” which in course of time came to be a plural
sign, just as in other instances it came to signify the
numeral “three.” In the Aryan languages M. Bergaigne
has shown<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> that the plural of the weak cases (nominative,
accusative, and vocative) was identical with the
singular of abstract nouns, and their formatives, -<i>as</i> or
-<i>âs</i>, -<i>i</i> or -<i>î</i>, -<i>â</i> or -<i>yâ</i>, and -<i>an</i>, continued to the last to
mark abstracts like the Sanskrit <i>áhan</i>, “the day,” <i>lipi</i>,
“writing,” <i>vrajyâ</i>, “the act of travelling,” or <i>mudâ</i>, “joy.”
So in Semitic Assyrian, where an abstract is generally
regarded as feminine, the feminine plural in -<i>utu</i> has
become the termination of singular nouns like <i>śarrutu</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
“a kingdom,” and then by a curious change of function
been appropriated to a certain class of masculine plurals.
There are reasons for thinking that the Semitic plural
has been based on the dual; however this may be, the
suffixes of the Aryan plural, so far at least as the weak
cases are concerned, are suffixes which we find elsewhere
used as secondary and not classificatory ones.</p>

<p>Even the genitive case, necessary as it appears to us to
be, once had no existence, as indeed it still has none in
groups of languages like the Taic or the Malay. Instead
of the genitive, we here have two nouns placed in apposition
to one another, two individuals, as it were, set side
by side without any effort being made to determine their
exact relations beyond the mere fact that one precedes
the other, and is therefore thought of first. Which of the
two should thus precede depended on the psychological
point of view of the primitive speaker. We are all acquainted
with the distinction between the objective genitive
where the governed word is the object of the other,
as in <i>amor Socratis</i>, “love felt for Socrates,” and the subjective
genitive where the converse is the case, as in
<i>Socratis amor</i>, “love felt by Socrates,” and this distinction
has led to two different conceptions of the genitive
relation being formed by different races. In the Aryan
family, for instance, the genitive must precede its governing
noun; <i>Horsetown</i>, equally with <i>horse’s town</i>, means
“town of the horse.” In Semitic, on the contrary, the
position of the words is reversed; here the genitive has
to follow, not precede. Perhaps we may see in the position
of the genitive in the two great inflectional families
of speech a symbol of the characters of the two races.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
The Aryan, the inventor of induction and the scientific
method, fixes his first attention on the phænomenon and
traces it up to its source; the Semite, on the other
hand, makes the first cause his starting-point, and
derives therefrom with easy assurance all the varying
phænomena that surround him.</p>

<p>Now, this apposition of two nouns, which still serves
the purpose of the genitive in many languages, might be
regarded either as attributive or as predicative. If predicative,
then the two contrasted nouns formed a complete
sentence, “cup gold,” for instance, being equivalent
to “the cup is gold.” If attributive, then one of the two
nouns took the place of an adjective, “gold cup” being
nothing more than “a golden cup.” The apposition of two
substantives is thus the germ out of which no less than
three grammatical conceptions have developed—those of
the genitive, of the predicate, and of the adjective. It is but
another instance of that principle of differentiation which
we have found at work upon the phonetic forms whereby
the relations of grammar are expressed. Dr. Friedrich
Müller has observed<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> that, as a general rule, the attribute
and the genitive, or as he terms it the possessive, occupy
the same place, and are treated as one and the same
relation. In Hottentot, as in Chinese, where the defining
noun must precede that which is defined, “right-path”
means equally “the right path” and “the path of right,”
and our own English language is another example of the
same usage. In Malay, on the contrary, as in the Semitic
tongues, both adjective and genitive have to follow the
noun they define; thus the Malayan <i>ōran ūtan</i>, or “man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
of the wood,” is literally “man-wood,” and <i>gūmin besar</i>,
“a great mountain,” “mountain-great.” On the other
hand, the predicative relation is marked off from the
attributive and genitival by a converse order of words;
in Malay, for instance, the predicate is placed before its
subject, as in <i>besar gūmin</i>, “great (is) the mountain,” and
the Semitic perfect is formed by affixing the pronouns of
the first and second persons to a participle or verbal
noun.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> These primitive contrivances for distinguishing
between the predicate, the attribute, and the genitive,
when the three ideas had in the course of ages been
evolved by the mind of the speaker, gradually gave way
to the later and more refined machinery of suffixes,
auxiliaries, and the like.</p>

<p>Now it will be noticed that while the predicative
relation is contrasted with the attributive and the genitival,
the two latter assume the same form. Where the
relations of grammar are denoted by position alone, no
distinction is made between the attribute and the possessive.
There is nothing in the outward form to tell us
whether in expressions like <i>horsetown</i> or <i>ōran ūtan</i>,
<i>horse</i> and <i>ūtan</i> are to be considered as adjectives or as
genitives. And in point of fact there is at bottom little
or no difference between them. The primitive instinct
of language did not err in treating the two conceptions
as essentially one and the same. A “gold cup” is
exactly equivalent to a “cup of gold.” The adjective
describes the attribute which defines and limits the class
to which its substantive belongs; and so, too, does the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
genitive. Both indicate the species of a genus, limiting
the signification of the substantive, and so having the
same functions as those determinatives which, as we
have seen, play so large a part in a Chinese or Burman
dictionary. In such languages these defining words
perform the same classificatory office as the classificatory
suffixes of an Aryan dialect; but whereas the classificatory
suffixes of an inflectional tongue are neither
adjectives nor attributes, the classificatory substantives
of the isolating language are really both. We are told
that a school-inspector plucked some children a short
time ago for saying that <i>cannon</i> in <i>cannon-ball</i> was a noun
instead of an adjective; the pedantry of the act was only
equal to the ignorance it displays, and illustrates how
often the artificial nomenclature of grammar breaks
down when confronted with the real facts of language.</p>

<p>So long therefore as the adjective or genitive is
denoted by position only, we cannot draw any true line
of distinction between them and the determinatives of
the Taic idioms. They all have the same end—that of
limiting and defining a noun—of referring it to some
special class or investing it with some special quality.
Hence it is that the genitive case so frequently assumes
the form of an adjective, even in those languages in
which the adjective and the genitive have been eventually
distinguished from one another. In the Tibetan dialects
adjectives are formed from substantives by the addition
of the sign of the genitive, as <i>ser-gyi</i>, “golden,” from <i>ser</i>,
“gold;” and in Hindustani the genitive takes the marks
of gender according to the words to which it refers.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
Greek adjectives like δημό-σιο-ς remind us of the old genitive
δημοσιο, which has become δημοῖο in Homer, or the
Sanskrit genitive <i>śiva-sya</i> and the pronouns <i>ta-syâ-s</i>
and <i>ta-sya-i</i>, and though the suffix of δημό-σιο-ς was
originally rather -<i>tya</i> than -<i>sya</i>, since a Greek sibilant
between two vowels tends to disappear, the two suffixes
once performed the same functions and bore the same
relation to each other as the demonstratives <i>sa</i> and <i>ta</i>.
The Aryan genitive stands on the same footing as the
other cases of the nouns which have been traced back by
M. Bergaigne to adjectives used adverbially. If we look
at the Bâ-ntu languages we shall have little difficulty
in understanding the reason of this close connexion
between adjective and genitive. As we have seen, the
agreement of words together in these languages is
pointed out by the use of common prefixes, which were
once independent substantives, and have come to answer
somewhat to the marks of gender in Greek and Latin.
The same prefixes, however, not only indicate the concord
of adjective and substantive, of verb and subject,
but also of nominative and genitive. Thus the Zulu
would say <span class="allsmcap">I-SI</span>-<i>tya</i> <span class="allsmcap">S-O</span>-<i>m-fazi</i>, “the dish of the woman,”
where the common prefix <i>si</i> declares the relation that
exists between the two ideas. If we assume that the
primary meaning of <i>si</i> was “mass,” the words <span class="allsmcap">I-SI</span>-<i>tya</i>
<span class="allsmcap">S-O</span>-<i>m-fazi</i> would properly be read “mass-dish mass-woman.”
The word <i>si</i> is thus the standard and connecting
link by means of which the other two are brought
together and compared. It had been attached to a
certain group of words at a time when the conception of
adjective or genitive had not yet been clearly realized,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
and when mere position, mere apposition, indicated by
itself the association of two ideas. This close association
caused it finally to lose all distinctive existence of its
own, to become, in short, an “empty word” or formative,
the index of a particular class like the classificatory
suffixes of our own tongues. Like these suffixes, again,
it came to have what would be called in Sanskrit or
Greek a flectional power; it not only marked the class
to which the substantive belonged, but also the fact that
another word was in concord with it. Whether this were
a concord of the adjective or the genitive, however, the
Kafir dialects have never advanced so far as to determine.</p>

<p>Unlike either the Kafir with prefixes which denote at
once attribute, possessive, and even predicate, or the
Aryan languages with their suffixes each fulfilling a
special function, the Semitic tongues distinguished between
genitive and adjective by subordinating the
governing word to its “genitive,” and keeping the attention
fixed on the characteristics which separated species
from species within a common genus. While the adjective
constituted an independent word by the side of the
substantive with which it was joined, the genitive was
regarded merely as the latter half of a compound of
which the word defined by it was the first part. In the
so-called <i>construct state</i>, the governing noun is pronounced,
as it were, in one breath with the genitive that
follows it; its vowels are shortened, and its case-terminations
tend to disappear. Thus in Assyrian, while <i>śarru
rabu</i> is “great king,” <i>śar rabi</i> is “king of great ones,”
and in Hebrew the construct <i>dhiv’rê hâ’âm</i>, “words of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
people,” stands in marked contrast to the simple <i>dhĕvârim</i>,
“words.”</p>

<p>The agglutinative languages of Western Asia, again,
traversed an altogether different road. In the Accadian
of ancient Chaldea, we still find instances in the oldest
inscriptions of a genitive by position, which only differs
from an adjective by the meaning it bears. Thus, <i>lugal
calga</i> is “strong king,” <i>lugal’Uru</i>, “king of Ur.” But a
postposition soon came to be added to the second substantive
in order to point out more distinctly its place in
the sentence, and these postpositions seem originally to
have been verbs. At all events, such is the case with
one of the postpositions, <i>lal</i>, used for the genitive; <i>lugal
’Uru-lal</i>, for instance, being literally “king Ur-filling,”
though the more usual postposition -<i>na</i> has lost all traces
of its source and derivation. The latter postposition is
found throughout the Ural-Altaic family, as in the
Turkish <i>evin</i>, “of a house,” or the Votiak <i>murten</i>, “by a
man.” It indicates the genitive in Finnish and Lapp, in
Mordvin and Samoyed, in Mongol (-<i>yin</i>, -<i>un</i>), and Mantschu
(-<i>ni</i>). It is somewhat remarkable that though the
Ural-Altaic family is characterized by the use of postpositions,
that is, by making the defining word follow that
which it defines, the modern dialects, with a few exceptions,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
have discarded the general rule and placed the adjective
before its noun. This change of position must be
ascribed to a wish for differentiation, when the employment
of a special postposition for the genitival relation
had familiarized the speaker with the distinction between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
adjective and genitive. Elsewhere the distinction was
brought into relief by the help of special words or
symbols to denote the genitive relation. Just as the
Accadians or the Finns employed a postposition which
was originally an independent word with a meaning of
its own, so, too, the Semites replaced the “construct
state” by the insertion of the demonstrative or relative
pronoun, <i>śarru sa rabi</i>, for example, literally “king that
(is) the great ones,” coming to signify simply “king of
the great ones,” and the Chinese assigned the same office
to their <i>tchi</i>, “place.” The analytic languages of modern
Europe have followed in the same track, only employing
prepositions like <i>de</i>, <i>of</i>, or <i>von</i>, instead of demonstrative
pronouns or other words. When the conception of
the genitive had once been clearly recognized, means
were soon found for making it as clear in phonetic expression
as it was in idea, and the ambiguous machinery
of flection was superseded by a method of expression
which had been familiar to the more advanced Ural-Altaic
idioms from a very remote period.</p>

<p>The history of the genitive has shown us that the same
germ may develop very differently in different families
of speech. The conception of the genitival relation,
when fully realized, has worn a varying aspect to Aryans
and Semites, to Accadians and Kafirs. The same
grammatical relation admits of being looked at from
many points of view, and of being expressed in many
ways. Let us now turn to another adjunct of grammar
which has assumed more than one form within the same
family of speech itself. A definite article is by no means
a universal possession of language; on the contrary, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
majority of languages want it altogether, and wherever
it makes its appearance we can trace it back to the
demonstrative pronoun, with which it is still identical in
German. “That man” and “the man” are in fact one
and the same, the only difference between them being
that the demonstrative draws emphatic attention to a
particular individual, while the article acts like a classificatory
suffix by narrowing the boundaries of a genus
and reducing it to the condition of a species. The
article has thus the same ultimate function as the adjective
or the genitive, and we should therefore expect to
find it following the lead of the latter and occupying the
same position in the sentence. This, however, is not the
case. It is true that in English and German the article
precedes the noun, but it does the same in Hebrew and
Arabic, as also in Old Egyptian, where the adjective
follows its substantive; while, on the other hand, in
Scandinavian, as in Wallach, Bulgarian, and Albanian,
the place of the article is after its noun. The cause of
this irregularity is the fact that the article is a very late
product in any speech; it does not grow out of the
demonstrative until an age which has lost all recollection
of the early contrivances of language and found other
means than mere position for indicating the attribute of
the noun. How late this is may be judged from the
absence of the definite article in dialects cognate to those
which possess one. Thus in the Semitic languages there
is none in either Ethiopic or Assyrian, except in the
very latest period of the latter tongue; among the Aryan
dialects, Russian and the other Slavonic idioms (Bulgarian
excepted) have no article, the Greek article being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
very inadequately represented by the relative pronoun
<i>ije</i> in Old Slavonic, while Sanskrit also may be said to
be without one, though the demonstrative <i>sa</i> sometimes
takes its place, as in <i>sa purusha</i> like <i>ille vir</i> in Latin.
Neither the Finnic nor the Turkish-Tatar languages
have an article, Osmanli Turkish alone occasionally
having recourse to the Persian mode of expressing it by
a <i>kezra</i> (<i>i</i>) or <i>hemza</i> (ʾ) as in <i>nawale-y-ushk</i>, “the lamentations
of love;” Hungarian, however, has been so far
influenced by the neighbouring German dialects as to
turn the demonstrative <i>az</i> or <i>a</i> into a genuine article, as
in <i>az atya</i>, “the father,” <i>a leány</i>, “the daughter.” On
the other hand, the objective case, or “casus definitus,”
as Böhtlingk terms it, seems formed by a demonstrative
affix not only in Turkish-Tatar, but also in Mongol and
even Tibetan; in Mongol, for instance, it is marked by a
suffix which is commonly pronounced -<i>yighi</i>.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> This
definite case very often answers exactly to the use of a
definite article with the noun, and has arisen through
a similar desire to give definiteness and precision to the
expression. So, too, Castrén tells us that an affix -<i>et</i> or -<i>t</i>,
which he believes to be the pronoun of the third person,
is sometimes attached to the Ostiak accusative, and in
Hindustani, where there is no definite article, its place is
taken before the accusative by a dative with the suffix
-<i>ko</i>, and in Persian by the suffix -<i>ra</i>, a suffix, by the way,
which Schott considers to have been borrowed from the
Tatar or Mongol tongues. We may judge how attributive
and defining is the nature of the objective case from
the Chinese, where the same empty word <i>tchi</i>, which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
according to Dr. Edkins, was originally <i>ti</i>, is the affix of
both the objective and the possessive cases. Passing to
the New World, we find the Algonkins alone among the
North American Indians prefixing the article <i>mo</i> or <i>m’</i>,
originally a contracted form of the demonstrative <i>monko</i>,
“that,” while the monosyllabic Othomis use <i>na</i> and <i>ya</i>
in the same sense.</p>

<p>But now the question arises—granting the late growth
of the definite article and its appearance only here and
there in a group of allied languages—Why do some of
these use it as a prefix and others as an affix? As in
Greek, or Keltic, or Teutonic, the Romanic article which
has been developed out of the Latin <i>ille</i> always precedes
its noun, except in Wallachian, where “the master” must
be rendered by <i>domnul</i>, that is, <i>dominus ille</i>. Professor
Max Müller thinks that this position of the article was
borrowed from Wallachian by the Bulgarians and Albanians;<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
M. Benlöw, on the contrary, holds that
Albanian set the example both to Wallach and to Bulgarian.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
Assuming that Albanian belongs to the Indo-European
family of speech—a point, however, which has
yet to be satisfactorily determined—we should still have
an Aryan language reversing the usual order of Aryan
speech. Thus ἔμερ is “name,” but ἔμερι, “the name;” δέ is
“earth,” but δέου, “the earth;” δέῤῥε, “door,” but δέῤῥα, “the
door;” νιερὶ, “man,” in the accusative, but νιερί-νε, “the
man;” νιέρεζ, “men,” but νιέρεζι-τ(ε), “the men.” Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
may be thought of Albanian, however, we have a clear
case of the postposition of the Aryan article in the Scandinavian
tongues, where the Swedish <i>werld-en</i>, for instance,
signifies “the world,” <i>luft-en</i>, “the air,” and it is,
perhaps, curious that the Scandinavians, like the Albanians,
are natives of a comparatively cold and mountainous
country. Mountaineers are famous for the use
of their lungs, and a postfixed article is necessarily more
emphatic than a prefixed one. More effort is required
in laying stress on the last syllable of a word than in
slurring it over and throwing the accent back.</p>

<p>Now M. Bergaigne has shown<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> that in the primitive
Aryan sentence the qualifying word, whether adjective
or genitive or adverb, came before the subject and governing
word, and this agrees with what we have seen
was the early conception formed by the Aryan mind of
the attributive relation in contrast to that formed by the
Semitic. We should therefore expect to find the article
following the rule of other qualifying words, and standing
before its noun in the Aryan tongues, and after its noun
in the Semitic tongues. So far as the Aryan tongues are
concerned, this is its general position. The German
dialects which have maintained so firmly the place of
the adjective and the genitive have been equally firm in
maintaining the place of the definite article.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> If Wallach
influenced Bulgarian and Albanian in affixing the article,
an explanation may be found in the forgetfulness shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
by the Romanic idioms of the early rule of Aryan speech,
as evidenced by their putting the adjective after the substantive;
if, as seems more probable, Wallach and Bulgarian
were influenced by Albanian, we must bear in
mind that the latter language may not be Aryan at all.
As for Swedish and the other Scandinavian dialects, the
inverted position of the article may be ascribed to what
we may call the disorganization of their syntax. While
Gothic observed the old rule which made the dependent
and defining word precede, it is very noticeable that
already in the Icelandic Snorra Edda the genitive without
a preposition occurs not only before, but also after
its noun. The syntactical instinct of the language was
thus disturbed, and there was therefore little to prevent
a new defining word like the article from occupying an
anomalous place. In the Semitic languages Aramaic
alone assigns a natural position to the article, which is
represented by the so-called <i>emphatic aleph</i> attached to a
noun when not otherwise defined by being in the construct
state. Now there are many reasons which would
lead us to believe that Aramaic was the first of the
Semitic dialects in which the article developed itself, and
that this happened shortly after its separation from the
dialect which subsequently branched off into Hebrew,
Phœnician, and Assyrian. The article did not make its
appearance in Hebrew or Arabic until the old order of
the sentence had been thrown into confusion by rhetorical
inversions and the periphrastic genitive formed
by the demonstrative pronoun. How it came to be prefixed
to its noun is illustrated by the Assyrian. Here a
kind of article makes its appearance in the Persian period,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
which, when placed after its noun, has the force of the
demonstrative “this” or “that.” Now and then, however,
we find it in conjunction with another demonstrative
before the noun, a construction which can easily be explained
if we regard the demonstrative and the noun as
having been first in apposition, and then brought so
closely together that the demonstrative became an article.
In Arabic, too, the demonstrative can be prefixed to a
noun which is already furnished with the article, and the
pronoun and noun are thus regarded as being in apposition
to one another. The same is the case in Hebrew,
where we occasionally meet with a construction like <i>zeh
hâ’âm</i>, “this people,” literally “this the people,” as well
as <i>zeh Mosheh</i>, “this Moses.”<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The last example shows
us that a proper name was considered definite enough to
be put in apposition to the pronoun, even when without
the article, and it is not difficult to assume that an usage
which first grew up in the case of proper names, should
in time have extended itself to all nouns which were considered
definite. Even the adjective <i>rabbim</i>, “many,” is
found preceding its noun.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The preservation of the case-endings
in Hebrew and Arabic may have had something
to do with the position chosen by the article; it was
easy enough for a demonstrative to pass into an affixed
article in Aramaic, where the case-endings seem to have
perished early, but it was only possible for it to do so in
languages where they were preserved by its standing
before the noun. Old Egyptian agrees with Hebrew and
Arabic in the general rule of placing the determining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
word after the word it determines; it also agrees with
them in prefixing the article. But this, again, may be
explained by the use of the demonstrative as an article
having originated in its apposition to the substantive;
while the use of <i>ua</i>, “one,” as an indefinite article probably
assisted in the process. Of course, when a definite article
had once come into existence, a difference of position
served to distinguish it from the demonstrative pronouns
to which it had formerly belonged.</p>

<p>This long inquiry into the causes which have made
the article sometimes an affix and sometimes a prefix has
introduced us to the last department of the morphology
of speech—that which is known as syntax, or the arrangement
of words in a sentence. Professor Earle has remarked
that syntax varies inversely as accidence; wherever
we have an elaborate formal grammar, there we have
a corresponding poverty of syntax; wherever we have little
formal grammar, as in Chinese or English, there syntax
comes prominently into view. This is only another way
of stating the fact that in default of such contrivances as
inflections, language has recourse to rules of position in
order to denote the grammatical relations of words; and
though Greek shows us that a highly developed accidence
may exist along with an equally developed syntax, yet
it is quite true that a language which makes such large
use of composition as Sanskrit, must be very poor in the
matter of syntax. Composition and syntax are antagonistic
to each other. The study of comparative accidence,
or, as it is rather loosely called, comparative
grammar, is much in advance of that of comparative
syntax; indeed, it is but lately that comparative syntax<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
has attracted the attention of philologists to any extent,
Jolly, Delbrück, Bergaigne, and others being among the
pioneers of this branch of linguistic science. Here, too,
we must work back to that inner form which underlies
the choice of the position of words in a sentence; we
must find out by the comparative method what were the
primary syntactical rules observed by a group of cognate
tongues, what were the grammatical conceptions
they indicated, and how they were modified by the
several languages in the course of their subsequent history.
The germs of syntax are capable of infinitely
various development, although each family of speech
starts with its own special point of view, its own particular
principle. The Aryan began by placing the defining
word before the word defined; the Semite by
placing it after; just as in Burman the defining word
precedes, while in Siamese or Tai it follows. Languages,
which have never attained to the idea of a verb, like the
Polynesian, must necessarily differ materially from those
in which the verbal conjugation plays a principal part;
while in the polysynthetic languages of America, syntax
in the proper sense of the term can hardly be said to
exist at all. Unlike formal grammar, however, syntax
is comparatively changeable; Coptic has become a prefix
language, whereas its parent, Old Egyptian, was an
affix one, and the growth of rhetoric as well as the development
of grammatical forms tend to obliterate the
old landmarks and principles of syntactical arrangement.</p>

<p>The history of the accusative with the infinitive in
Latin is a good example of this. Prof. Max Müller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
describes his utter amazement when he was first taught
to say, <i>Miror te ad me nihil scribere</i>, “I am surprised
that you write nothing to me,”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> and there was plenty of
reason for it. He has clearly shown that most of the
Greek and Latin infinitives were originally dative cases
of abstract nouns, and not locatives, as has often been
maintained; the Greek δοῦναι or δοϝέναι, for instance, answering
to the Vedic <i>dâváne</i>, “to give,” τετυπέναι to <i>vibhráne</i>,
“to conquer” or “effect,” <i>amare</i>, <i>monere</i>, <i>audire</i>, to
<i>jîv-áse</i>, “to live.” The Greek middle infinitive in -θαι is a
relic of the Vedic dative of an abstract infinitive from
the root <i>dhâ</i>, “to do” or “place,” ψευδέσ-θαι, “to do lying,”
exactly answering to the Vedic <i>vayodhai</i> (for <i>váyas-dhai</i>),
“to do living,” or “to live,” on the model of which
analogy has created the false forms τύψεσθαι, τύψασθαι and
τυψθήσεσθαι. The true character of the Latin infinitive
may be discovered from the verb <i>fieri</i>, which goes back
to an earlier <i>fiesei</i>, the dative of a stem in -<i>s</i>. Bearing in
mind, then, what the infinitive originally was, we have
little difficulty in understanding how it came to be used
with an accusative, which was really the object after the
principal verb. The sentence quoted above simply meant
at first: “I am surprised at you for the writing of nothing
to me,” just as <i>te volo vivere</i> was “I choose you for
living,” or <i>tempus est videndi lunæ</i>, “it is the time of the
moon, of seeing (it);” and the extension of the use of the
accusative with the infinitive to sentences in which we
can no longer trace any reflection of its original force, is
only another example of the power of analogy in spreading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
a particular habit, the proper sense and meaning of
which have been forgotten.</p>

<p>Let us remember, however, that at the time when an
Aryan syntax was first forming itself, there was as yet
no distinction between noun and verb. The accusative
and genitive relations of after days did not yet exist;
they were still merged together in a common attributive
or defining relation, and the growth of the verb was
necessary before a genitive could be set apart to define
the substantive, and an accusative or object to define the
verb. Reminiscences of this primitive state of things
have survived into the later forms of speech. When
Plautus says, “Quid tibi hanc tactio est,” he is using
<i>tactio</i> as he would <i>tango</i>, and while in the Rig-Veda nouns
in -<i>tar</i> govern an accusative like transitive verbs, we
actually find a verb undergoing comparison in <i>bhavatitarâm</i>,
“he is more so.” In fact, genitive and accusative
alike are what Mr. Sweet calls “attribute-words,” the
one being the attribute of the noun, the other of the
verb, and before there was any distinction between verb
and noun there could be no distinction between them
also. The modern Englishman may well ask whether
there is any difference between “the performing this,”
and “the performing of this;” or between “doing a
thing,” and “doing badly.” The Latin supines and
gerunds, which are petrified cases of nouns, are followed
by what are termed “the cases of their verbs,” and the
so-called indeclinable participles of Sanskrit, which are
really instrumentals of nouns in -<i>tu</i>, equally take the
accusative after them. In Greek εὐτυχώς ἔχειν has the
same meaning as εὐτυχίαν ἔχειν, and the Greek and Sanskrit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
use of an accusative with the verb “to be,” shows
us how artificial are our distinctions between transitive
and intransitive verbs. The adverbial sense of the accusative
comes out plainly in the Homeric ἀκήν ἔσαν, and
is one more proof of the fact that the accusative, like the
genitive, must be classed along with the adjective and
the adverb as a qualifying word that defines and limits
the words to which it is attached. Custom and grammatical
development have alone determined how such
qualifying words should be severally used.</p>

<p>The languages of our family of speech are in fair
agreement as to the employment of the accusative and
the genitive; there are other syntactical contrivances,
however, where such an agreement is not to be found.
The “ablative absolute” of Latin, for instance, is replaced
by a genitive absolute in Greek, by a dative in Lithuanian,
by a locative, sometimes also a genitive, and very
rarely an ablative, in Sanskrit. In old English we have
apparently a dative (as in Anglo-Saxon), as when Wycliffe
writes, “they have stolen him, us sleping,” whereas,
as Mr. Peile observes,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> we should now say, “we sleeping,”
using the nominative as occasionally in Greek. As a
matter of fact, this so-called “casus absolutus,” this case
“freed” from all government, and standing outside the
sentence to the perpetual astonishment of the grammarians,
is really a qualificatory word, dependent like the
adverb upon the verb, and denoting the circumstances,
or instrument, or mode of an action. Instead of the construction
used by Wycliffe, we might just as well have
had, “they have stolen him during our sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the first thing that strikes us when we first
learn the classical languages, and more especially Latin,
is the freedom with which words are dropped <i>pêle-mêle</i>,
as it were, into a sentence. This power of transposing
words stands in marked contrast with the comparatively
fixed order of words in a modern European
language. When Tennyson says, “Thee nor carketh
care nor slander,” we feel that he has gone to the extreme
length of what is possible even in poetry, and the arrangement
of a German sentence, in spite of its inflections,
is determined by somewhat severe rules. We must
remember, however, that the apparent freedom of the
classical languages is due in great measure to the artificial
style of literary men who took advantage of the
inflectional character of the dialects they spoke to invert
the position of words for rhetorical purposes, and that
such inversions were not usual in the language of everyday
life. We cannot judge a language properly from
the works of its literary men, and this is particularly the
case with Latin, where the language of literature was
divided by a great gulf from the language of the streets.
But even in Latin we find the verb gravitating towards
the end of the sentence; this is its predominant position,
for instance, throughout the second book of the “Gallic
War” of Cæsar, who represents the spoken language of his
time much more closely than most of the other authors
of Rome. Now, M. Bergaigne, in the very able series of
articles already referred to,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> has lately tried to show that
this was not always the position of the Aryan verb. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
begins by distinguishing between <i>phænomena</i>, or qualities
and acts, and <i>objects</i> which are recognized either as bearing
these qualities, or as the ends and instruments of the
acts. His phænomena, therefore, will answer to our
qualificatory words, and a sentence in which they occupy
the principal place will be a predicative one, just as
sentences in which an object is brought into prominence
will be “sentences of dependence.” The substantive
verb is but a late creation; even in Latin a sentence
like “majorum benefacta perlecta” is perfectly intelligible
though “sunt” is omitted; and such a phrase as <i>Deus est
sanctus</i> meant at first “God exists as a holy being,” the
adjective being a predicative attribute or “phænomenon”
in apposition to <i>Deus</i>. It was only by degrees that the
sense of “existence” disappeared from the verb, and it became
a simple copula. More than once we have referred
to the primary rule of Aryan syntax, according to which
the qualifying word is placed before the word qualified;
this is a rule which is borne witness to by almost every
compound, by the verb which affixes the personal pronouns
to its stem; nay, even by our own English, which
still makes the adjective precede its noun. Where the
rule seems to be violated, an explanation is generally
forthcoming. Latin and Greek compounds like <i>versipellis</i>
or φιλάδελφος, really signify “who has the skin
changed,” “one who has a brother beloved,” the first
part of the German <i>tauge-nichts</i>, our <i>dare-devil</i>, is an
imperative, and the second element in the Sanskrit
<i>dṛishṭa-pûrvva</i>, “seen before,” is a pronoun. Whether
Bergaigne is right in following Grimm’s explanation of
compounds like φερέ-ϝοικος, παυσί-νοσος, as containing imperatives,
is an open question, though in the Rig-Veda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
the imperative and conjunctive are certainly inverted
and set before their case; it is more probable that we
are here dealing with instances of false analogy, δαμάσιππος,
“she who tames horses,” having been made equivalent
to ἱππόδαμος “horse-tamer,” and so made the model
of a new formation. As for the <i>hippopotamus</i>, or “river-horse,”
the animal came from Egypt, and so, too, did the
manner of compounding its name. Proper names like
Ἀγαθός δαίμων, or <i>Neapolis</i>, are scarcely in point; in them,
moreover, the attribute and subject are in apposition.
The curious use of the article in Greek with two nouns,
one of which is a genitive, is based upon a different
reason. When the article had once established itself in
speech, ὁ τοῦ χοροῦ διδάσκαλος exactly answered to ὁ χοροδιδάσκαλος,
“the choir-master,” and the second noun being
drawn back to the place of its article, we get ὁ διδάσκαλος
τοῦ χοροῦ and ὁ διδάσκαλος ὁ τοῦ χοροῦ, an order which is
observed in modern Albanian. Turning to Latin, we
find that the adjective when placed after the substantive
implies a sentence of predication, <i>res militaris</i> being “a
thing which is military,” <i>navis longa</i>, “a ship which is
long.” It is only proper names compounded with <i>Forum</i>
and <i>Portus</i>, like <i>Forum Julii</i>, which reverse the order of
words as we have it in <i>juris-consultor</i>, and in these proper
names the stress is on the second part of the compound.
The altered position of the adjective in the Romance
languages is probably due to the influence of the periphrastic
genitive with the preposition <i>de</i>; at all events the
older constructions place the adjective before its noun.</p>

<p>The rule followed by genitives and adjectives must
have been followed by verbs, which are merely attributes
of their subjects, and the formation of the verb by affixing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
the personal pronouns to the attribute or verbal stem
confirms this conclusion. In the primitive sentence the
object would have come first, then the attribute or verb,
and lastly the subject; and the Latin <i>credo</i>, which has
the same origin as the Sanskrit <i>śrad-dadhâmi</i>, “heart-placing-I,”
is a good illustration of it. But a want came
to be felt of distinguishing between the attribute as a
mere qualificative and the attribute as a predicate, and
so while the old order remained the type of a qualificative
sentence, it was reversed in predicative sentences;
the subject was put at the beginning and the verb at the
end. This process was assisted by the division of the
sentence into two halves, one-half consisting of the subject
with its dependent words, and the other half of the
verb and object; and if we suppose that each half was
represented by a single compound, we can easily see how
ready to hand the process would have been. Indeed, the
verb seems to fix itself at the end of the sentence almost
naturally, since the deaf-mute when taught to communicate
with others, invariably sets the verb in this position,
the subject and object to which his thought is chiefly
directed being the first to occur to his mind. It is this
position of the verbal attribute which has established
itself in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Anglo-Saxon;
which still is the rule in German in dependent sentences,
and has only been changed in English and the Scandinavian
and Romanic dialects through the analogy of the
substantive verb and the extended use of prepositions. A
preparation for the new arrangement of the sentence,
however, which places the object last, was already made
by the infinitive. On the one hand, the infinitive could
govern a case, and so was correctly preceded by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
governed word; on the other hand, it was itself a case
dependent on the principal verb. But its nominal character
was more and more obliterated by its employment
with verbs like <i>posse</i> or <i>velle</i>, <i>can</i> or <i>will</i>; “he has the
ability for doing,” gradually came to be “he can do.”
Hence in Homer, as in Old Latin and Old German, the
infinitive is mostly found at the end of the sentence,
originally, it is true, accompanied by its cases, but afterwards
standing alone to qualify the verb, and separated
by the latter from the cases with which it was construed.
But with all this confusion of the old order, such cases as
the ablative or instrumental still maintained their proper
position before the word they qualified, and when crystallized
into adverbs continued to stand preferably immediately
before the verb. Many of these adverbs afterwards
became prepositions, the government of the noun
passing from the verb to the adverb that accompanied
it; other prepositions, like the Latin <i>gratiâ</i> or the Greek
χάριν, originated in substantives construed with genitives;
and hence the preposition was first of all a postposition,
following and not preceding its case. Even
now <i>nach</i> stands after its case in German, and we
speak of <i>thereon</i> and <i>thereof</i>, <i>homeward</i> and <i>leeward</i>, to
say nothing of <i>God-wards</i> and <i>you-wards</i>, or of what is
told us of Chaucer’s Shipman,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> that “fful manye a
drauȝt of wyne hadde he i-drawe ffrom Burdeaux ward,”
while the Latin <i>mecum</i>, <i>nobiscum</i>, and the like, survived to
the last days of the language. So, too, in Anglo-Saxon
the preposition sometimes runs counter to its name by
coming after its case, as <i>hî wyrcað þone cyle hine on</i>,
“they produce cold him on,”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> but this construction is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
fully explained when we find the preposition occupying
the same place in an adverbial sense, as in the Saxon
Chronicle (1016): <i>se here him fleâh beforan</i>, “the army
him fled before.”</p>

<p>So long as sentences remained simple and unconnected,
there was but little reason for serious changes to
occur in the order of their words. But it was quite different
when an attempt began to be made to connect them
together, to compose sentences that were dependent or
subordinate. When a sentence became an object or
attribute of another, the arrangement that had hitherto
held good was necessarily thrown into confusion. Not
only might an idea be an attribute of an attribute, but
that again might be the attribute of another attribute.
This intimate connection and fusion of sentences seems
peculiarly suited to the genius of Aryan speech; where
a whole sentence could be expressed by a single long
compound, it was easy enough to make it dependent on
something else. The Semitic tongues, which held composition
in abhorrence, were equally averse to an intimate
connection of sentences; neither process was very compatible
with the habit of thought which placed the qualifying
word second instead of first, and we are left to
gather the relation of a subordinate sentence to a principal
one merely from their juxtaposition, or the monotonous
repetition of the simple conjunction “and.” Indeed,
the Semitic languages have not risen far above the
condition of the deaf-mute or the Polynesian, who have
no dependent sentences, each sentence standing complete
and entire by itself.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> If the Dayak wishes to express<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
even so simple a notion as “I thought that he was rich,”
he is obliged to say, <i>iṅgärä-ku iä tatau</i>, “my thought;
he rich.” What a contrast to the Greek language with
its manifold particles, its subtle analysis of thought, its
delicate expression of every shade of connection between
ideas! Such, however, had not always been the condition
even of the Greek language, or at all events of the language
from which it had sprung. If, for instance, we
examine the history of the relative sentence, we shall
find it growing by slow degrees out of simple subordination.
First of all it was merely set side by side with the
principal clause, as in Hebrew and Assyrian poetry, or
such English phrases as “This is the man I saw.” Next,
the object of the antecedent clause was represented in
the consequent by a demonstrative pronoun for the sake
of clearness and emphasis; and so we may say: “This
is the man, that (man) I saw.” Then in time the demonstrative
came to be used in all cases alike, and not only
where peculiar stress had to be laid; it ceased to be any
longer a pure demonstrative, and became a relative applied
by analogy to instances in which the demonstrative
could hardly have been employed.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>We have now passed in review all that is included
under the morphology of speech. The morphology of
speech is the reverse side of its physiology, dealing with
the spirit and inner life of the sentence just as the
physiology of speech deals with the outward frame. If
words are posterior to the sentence, if they are in fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
but so many crystallized and abbreviated sentences, that
part of the science of language which treats of their
meanings ought strictly to follow a chapter on morphology.
That which is most scientific, however, is not
always the most practically convenient, and such is the
case with our present subject. But we must not forget
that the signification of a word is really determined by
its relation to the other words with which it is combined,
and if this does not seem to be the case with the isolated
words we find in the dictionary, it is only because these
isolated words are petrified sentences whose meaning has
long ago been established, partly by reference to other
sentences, partly by a determination of the relations
between the parts of which they are composed. The
mutual relations of the elements of a sentence, as well
as of fully formed sentences, constitute grammar in its
widest sense; they constitute also the morphology of
language. A fact of grammar is a compound of two
things—the conception of a relation between one idea
and another, and the embodiment of this conception in
phonetic utterance. Both parts of the compound are
continually developing, and becoming at once simpler
and clearer, and the duty of the linguistic morphologist
is to trace the history of this development, and follow
it back to its earliest source. We have to discover the
different mental points of view from which the structure
of the sentence was regarded by the different races of
mankind, to investigate and compare the various contrivances
and processes through which these points of view
eventually found their fullest expression, to classify the
modes of denoting the relations of grammar at the disposal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
of language, to examine the nature of composition and
of stems in the groups of speech of which they are
characteristic, to analyze the conceptions of grammar
and determine the elements and germs out of which
they have sprung, and finally, to ascertain the true origin
and meaning of the so-called rules of syntax, and keep
record of the changes that take place in the arrangement
of words. The mind of man has indeed been cast everywhere
in the same mould, but the scenes amid which its
infancy was cradled, the conditions under which it grew
up, have differed materially and produced a corresponding
difference in the expression of its thoughts in language.
Two rivers may start from the same spring, but
one may flow, clear and limpid through granite mountain
ranges and silent forests into a tropical sea—the
other may run a turbid and discoloured course through
low marsh-lands, by steaming mills and crowded wharves
into a northern ocean. It is only when we have
thoroughly explored the morphology of each group of
kindred tongues, have seen how their inner form has
gradually expanded like the flower out of the seed, that
we can venture to bring our results together, to compare
the morphology of one group of languages with that of
another, and learn wherein they differ and wherein they
agree.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> A good idea of the character of his etymologizing may be
gathered from the following quotation:—“<i>Vestis</i> nomen factum est
per syncopen ex composito <i>perestis</i>, et mutato <i>r</i> in <i>s</i> (ut sæpe
factum est), <i>pesestis</i> sive <i>pesestas</i>, a verbo <i>per-edo</i>, <i>per-es</i>, <i>per-est</i>;
quo significatur, quidquid <i>peredit</i> et plane consumit et <i>perdit</i>
materiam quamque, unde facta est, ut lues illa epidemica pestis
appellationem obtinuerat.” Elsewhere he asserts that <i>sin</i> is derived
from σίνειν, while <i>so</i> is merely ὥς reversed. But Junius is
quite equalled by Scaliger, Voss, Wachter, and other philologists
of the same school. Thus Scaliger says (“De Caus.” c. 35):—“<i>Ordinis</i>
nomen Græcum est. Dicebant militibus tribuni—‘Hactenus
tibi licet; hic consistes: eò progrediere, huc revertere; ὅρον
δῶ,’ inde <i>ordo</i>;” and again (“De Caus.” c. 28) that <i>quatuor</i> is κατερα,
<i>i.e.</i> και ετερα (the aspirate being dropped as among the Æolians),
because when the Latins had counted “unum, alterum, tria; pro
<i>quarto</i> dixere <i>et alterum</i>.” Scaliger, again, agrees with Voss in
deriving “<i>opacus</i> ex <i>Ope</i>, hoc est, <i>terrâ</i>; nam umbræ et frigoris
captandi causa in subterraneos se specus abdebant,” and <i>pomum</i>
from πῶμα, because most fruits quench the thirst. Voss identifies
the Latin <i>rus</i> with the Greek ἄρουρα, “præciso <i>a</i>,” and declares:
“ab ἔπω, qua notat <i>operor</i>, venit Latinum <i>opus</i>.” Perhaps the
various etymologies proposed for the word <i>cause</i> by Perottus will
give the best illustration of what once passed for “a true account
of the origin of words.” It is either (1) from <i>chaos</i>, as being the
first cause of things, or (2) from καῦσις, because heat “kindles and
inflames us” to action, or (3) “a cavendo,” because a cause forewarns
(“cavet”) us that something should or should not be done,
or, finally (4), “a casu, quia causa accidit.” To these Voss adds a
fresh possibility, that <i>causa</i> comes from “<i>caiso</i>,” that is, “quærere
seu petere.” Perottus, again, derives “<i>locusta</i> ex <i>locus</i> et <i>ustus</i>,
quod tactu multa urat, morsu vero omnia erodat.” We cannot but
be struck by the ingenuity of these old scholars. Wachter, however,
offers us equally absurd etymologies in the field of modern
High German. Thus he brings <i>kämpfen</i> (from <i>campus</i>) from <i>kam</i>,
“the fist,” <i>cat</i> from <i>ge-wachten</i>, the French <i>guêter</i> (!), and agrees
with Clauberg in making <i>neigen</i> the source of <i>nacht</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> Where there is so much to choose from it is difficult to select;
but perhaps the richest morsels of the book are the reference of
the Latin suffix -<i>or</i> in words like <i>sonorous</i>, as well as the final
syllable of Hebrew words like <i>tabor</i>, to the “Celtic” <i>mhor</i>, “great,”
and the derivation of the Egyptian Rameses from the “Celtic”
<i>raromeireas</i>, “gasconading.” The author, however, cannot claim
to be <i>facile princeps</i> of the year in the matter of bad etymologizing.
A certain Mr. Boult has printed two papers, read before the
Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, in which, among
other novel statements, he informs us that <i>city</i> is derived from the
“Celtic” <i>sigh-tigh</i> or “peace-house;” <i>count</i> from <i>co-meas</i>, “united
assessment,” <i>alderman</i> from <i>all-dor-meann</i>, “chief of the great door,”
and <i>custom</i> from <i>cur-do-meas</i>, “rent of assessment.” It is needless
to observe that “Celtic” with both writers means the decayed
forms of an Irish dictionary.</p>

formed by the speeches of various animals, recited in modes of
pronouncing Bushman, said to be peculiar to the animals in whose
mouths they are placed. It is a remarkable attempt to imitate the
shape or position of the mouth of the kind of animal to be represented.
Among the Bushman sounds which are hereby affected,
and often entirely commuted, are principally the clicks. These are
either converted into other consonants, as into labials (in the language
of the Tortoise), or into palatals and compound dentals and
sibilants (as in the language of the Ichneumon), or into clicks
otherwise unknown in Bushman (as far as our present experience
goes), as in the language of the Jackal, who is introduced as making
use of a strange labial click, which bears to the ordinary labial
click a relation in sound similar to that which the palatal click
bears to the cerebral click. Again, the Moon—and it seems also
the Hare and the Anteater—substitute a most unpronounceable
click in place of all others, excepting the lip click. Another animal,
the Blue Crane, differs in its speech from the ordinary Bushman,
mainly by the insertion of a <i>tt</i> at the end of the first syllable
of almost every word.”</p>

This explanation of the causes of this difference between the two
kinds of voice (true and falsetto) is due to the observations of Garcia.
Various theories had previously been put forward to account for it.
J. Müller thought that in producing chest notes, the whole breadth
of the vocal chords vibrated, only their thin inner margins in producing
falsetto notes. Mayo and Magendie held that the falsetto
notes are produced by the vibrations of only one-half the length of
the vocal chords, when the glottis is partially closed; G. Weber
that they are due to the vibration of the chords in segments, separated
by nodal points, so that harmonics of the fundamental note
are formed. Pétrequin and Diday maintained that they are produced
by the vibration of the air itself in the glottis, without any
movement on the part of the vocal chords, while Wheatstone
thought that they are formed by the division of the air in the
trachea into harmonic lengths, the tone produced by the vocal
chords being thus reciprocated, since, besides vibrating by reciprocation
with a sonorous body, the vibrations of which are isochronous
with its own, a column of air may also vibrate by reciprocation
in its several lengths, the number of its vibrations being in this case
a multiple of those of the sonorous body.</p>

by placing the tongue against the side-teeth, and then withdrawing
it, whereas the Nama Hottentots produce it as far back as
possible, covering the whole of the palate with the tongue. The
palatal click of the Hottentots, which is very difficult to imitate,
seems to be found in one or two Kafir words. The clicks, it must
be noted, only occur in the Kafir dialects adjoining the Hottentots,
and the Kafir clicks “are only found in the place of other consonants,
and are used like consonants at the beginning of syllables,
whilst in Hottentot a guttural explosive consonant (<i>k</i>, <i>kh</i>, or <i>g</i>),
the faucal spirant <i>h</i> and the nasal <i>n</i>, can be immediately preceded
by a click, and form together with it the initial element of the
syllables.”</p>

a combination of dental click, aspirated labial and guttural tenuis

occurs in words of more than one syllable,” and “consists of a falling
tone on the first (the accented syllable), followed by a high tone
on the next. The high tone seems to be reached by a jump rather
than by a glide. The compound is, therefore, a compound rise
distributed over two syllables.” The other Swedish accent, the
simple tone, is the negative of the compound one, and answers to
the “glottal catch” or <i>stöd tone</i> of Danish.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193" class="label">[193]</a> To Brugman belongs the credit of first demonstrating the existence
of these three distinct vowel-sounds in the Parent-Aryan
(Kuhn’s “Zeitschrift,” 1877). Brugman has been criticized by Collitz
in Bezzenberger’s “Beiträge zur Kunde der indogermanischen
Sprachen,” ii. 4 (1878), who maintains that the three primitive
sounds were really <i>ĕ</i>, <i>ŏ</i>, <i>ă</i>, and not the indeterminate <i>a</i>¹, <i>a</i>², <i>a</i>³.
On the other hand, an able article by De Saussure in the “Mémoires
de la Société de Linguistique de Paris,” iii. 5 (1878), accepts
Brugman’s nomenclature, while criticizing and modifying some of
his conclusions. His <i>a</i>, Brugman’s <i>a</i>¹, became <i>e</i> in West Aryan,
and is never weakened into <i>i</i> or <i>u</i> in Sanskrit. His <i>a</i>² (also Brugman’s)
is the West Aryan <i>o</i>², and in Sanskrit is lengthened in an
open syllable (<i>e.g.</i> <i>jajâna</i> = γέγονε). In Latin <i>ŏ</i> often became <i>ĕ</i>, as
in <i>genu</i> (Greek γόνυ, Sansk. <i>jânu</i>). Different from this <i>o</i>² is another
<i>o</i>¹, standing in the same relation to a that <i>o</i>² does in Latin to <i>e</i>, and
answering to a Sanskrit <i>i</i> or <i>î</i>. Besides this short <i>o</i>¹ is also a long <i>ō</i>,
which appears also as <i>ā</i>, and corresponds with Sansk. <i>â</i>. De Saussure
further points out that velar <i>k</i> in Sanskrit is palatalized (becomes <i>ch</i>)
when followed by <i>a</i> (= <i>ĕ</i>) and <i>a</i>² (= <i>ŏ</i>).</p>

as the Goth. <i>tami-da</i> (“domitus”), answers to the Vedic <i>dami-tás</i>
(like the Greek κλυτός) where the accent is oxytone. Verner sums
up his conclusions as follows: (1) The original accentuation was
preserved in Teutonic even after the introduction of those changes
of sound characteristic of the Teutonic branch of the Aryan family;
(2) the accent, however, was no longer purely tonic, it had become
also an accent of stress; (3) the exceptional representation of an
Aryan <i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>p</i> at the beginning of a syllable by a Teutonic <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>,
<i>b</i> is due to the original accentuation of the words in which it occurs;
and (4) this is also the case with <i>z</i> or <i>r</i> in the place of <i>s</i>.</p>

develop out of a consonantal <i>n</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>r</i>. Fick (Bezzenberger’s “Beiträge,”
iv., 1878) has shown that Greek aorists like ἔδρακε or παθών owe
their α-vowel to this cause. The accentuation of the last syllable
occasioned the loss of the vowel of the present-stem (which Fick
proves to represent the oldest form of the verb), and out of the resulting
ἔδρκε or πθών grew ἔδρακε and παθών. The corresponding
Swarabhakti vowel in Teutonic is <i>u</i> (cfer. ἑκατόν, <i>i.e.</i> ἑκαντόν for
ἑκντόν, and Gothic <i>hund</i> (our <i>hundred</i>), ἄρκτος, and Gothic <i>vulfs</i>,
